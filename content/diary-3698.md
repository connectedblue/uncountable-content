<p>This morning <a href="https://wildacres.org.uk/">Wild Acres</a> were hosting an event for Transition Stroud as part of their <a href="https://transitionstroud.org/transition-stroud-action-groups/reimagine-strouds-tomorrow/">Reimagine Stroud&#8217;s Tomorrow</a> activities across the district.</p>



<p>Sarah is a business psychologist and led an interactive talk and discussion about how humans respond to change and what we need to be aware of when trying to lead people on giant topics such as climate change.</p>



<p>There was a variety of people there from town councils to charities and other organisations.  A lot of thought provoking discussion, and a chance to network and hear what other people are doing in these areas.</p>



<p>The thing I took from the day was a simple framework called EAST which can be used to test a campaign against to help it land better:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Easy</li>



<li>Attractive</li>



<li>Social</li>



<li>Timely</li>
</ul>



<p>If you can hit these four points when messaging to an audience, then it&#8217;s more likely to have better outcomes.</p>



<p>At lunchtime, we headed off and I went to the Bank cafe with Georgie to have lunch and discuss the next steps on the Wild Acres website.  She&#8217;s made huge progress in a new design which looks really good.  There&#8217;s a few more pages to add in, and then I&#8217;ll help to transition the content in the old format to the new site and put it all live.</p>
