<p>After a hectic summer and unplanned events taking over, I&#8217;m now looking forward to getting my winter activity programme together:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Winter habitat management with <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a>. This will be my seventh season with them.</li>



<li>Start up sections on the <a href="https://hub.dursleygreen.org.uk">Dursley Green Hub</a> for AI and see if a local community can spring up around the topic.</li>



<li>Management plan for Uley Common.</li>



<li>Continue to improve the consolidation of all my blog content under the root <a href="https://uncountable.uk/">uncountable.uk</a> domain, and use this as an opportunity to explore AI agent coding in more depth.</li>



<li>Organise the Winter Habitat management programme for Uley Trees and Meadows.</li>



<li>Winter projects at the Fromebridge Reserve with <a href="https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/">Stroud Valleys Project</a> and <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a></li>



<li>Helping students at Rednock with a lego robotics project.</li>



<li>Getting out to other <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> reserves on Thursday work parties.</li>



<li>Riverfly monitoring on three established sites</li>



<li>Planning the return of Code Club after the library refurbishment has completed in November.</li>



<li>Fromebridge Orchard monthly work party to keep the restored orchard managed.</li>



<li>Get more community involvement on producing content for <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a> and build up the traffic to the site.</li>



<li>Investigate whether to accept a director role in a local CIC.</li>



<li>Work with The Engine on a digital component of the new Escape Room planned for 2026.  This will also involve students of Rednock and some alumni of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Quite a list when you write it down.  There&#8217;s plenty of other admin type activities as well, so my calendar will be pretty full.</p>



<p>You can follow along in <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a> to see how I actually get on with this list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)">Then</h2>



<p>Now is now.</p>



<p>Soon now will be then.</p>
