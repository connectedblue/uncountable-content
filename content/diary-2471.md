<p>It was finally time to cut back the wildflowers in the back garden.  Pretty much all the seed has dropped by now, and there was a break in the weather.</p>



<p>I used the strimmer first to take away the long material, and then the lawnmower to get a really low cut.  This produced bare earth patches in most places.  I sprinkled some extra seed &#8211; mostly meadow grasses, kidney vetch and field scabious.  The rest of the species should grow back next year.</p>



<p>This simulates a hay cut, although I&#8217;ll be taking the clippings to the local tip.  Next March or early April, I&#8217;ll cut again to simulate grazing.  And then look forward to another wildflower display next summer.</p>
