<p>The <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> organised a one day course about water vole monitoring.  A number of volunteers from the trust and the <a href="https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk">Stroud Wildlife Survey Group</a> attended.</p>



<p>The course was run by Emily from the <a href="https://ptes.org/campaigns/water-voles/">People&#8217;s Trust for Endangered Species</a>.  A very high quality course with lots of information on field signs, threats, monitoring and their role in the environment.</p>



<p>Water voles have declined over 80% in the last 50 years, and a lot of work is going to preserve where they can be found.  This includes the Stroud Water Canal restoration.</p>



<p>You can register online as a <a href="https://watervoles.ptes.org/auth/register">water vole surveyor</a> and participate in the national monitoring programme</p>
