<p>I&#8217;ve been posting photos to <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/snapshots/">my own version of instagram</a> now for nearly two years and there&#8217;s around 550 captioned photos so far.</p>



<p>At some point in the future, I&#8217;ll figure out how to include the date also on the caption, but for now I just enjoy having my own photofeed to document things I see every week</p>
