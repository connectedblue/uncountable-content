<p>I love guestbooks.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guest-book/" data-type="post" data-id="187">one on my site</a> and it&#8217;s always a lovely feeling when someone drops by to leave a little note. I also do the same whenever I come across them.</p>



<p>Unlike comments, they are central to that page&#8217;s content.  They invite the reader to leave a mark.  A page of collaborative content, created by the audience.</p>



<p>The simplicity of the interface reduces the friction to contribute &#8211; couple of fields, no need to hand over email and a chance to advertise your own website if you wish.</p>



<p>So it got me thinking &#8230; can this interface be used in other ways to collaborate?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a few different ideas on my websites recently.  The first was for <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">the Artocalypse</a>.  This is a community of independent artists who come together to put on celebrations of art in a Expos a few times a year.</p>



<p>Each expo has a single visitor book, which appears under every exhibit, rather than buried away on another page.  So very much like a traditional guest book, except there are multiple places where you get a chance to leave your thoughts.  The <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2024-artocalypse-end-of-year-artist-feature/">2024 artist feature</a> gathered lots of feedback from visitors as a result. </p>



<p>Another example, which is a very different to the traditional guestbook use case, is to create collaborative content on very specific topics.  I recently asked the question  <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-did-you-make-a-website/" data-type="post" data-id="2379">Why did you make a website</a> and readers were able to submit their answers directly in the page using the guestbook interface.</p>



<p>And very recently, we used it to great effect for our current Poetry Expo. One of the activities is a <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/2025-micro-poetry-jam/">Micro Poetry Jam</a>, where we invite readers to submit a small verse, there and then on the spot.</p>



<p>And you guessed it &#8211; the guestbook interface was customised again to make the interactive input form and display of submissions.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d love to collect more examples of how guestbooks can be used to create engaging, interactive experiences on your website.  Drop me an email on <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a> if you come across any, or use them yourself.</p>
