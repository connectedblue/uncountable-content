<p>One of the joys of reading blogs instead of social media is the discovery of personal journeys.</p>



<p>After reading Tracy&#8217;s <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/05/17/when-is-it-time/">When is it time?</a>, I was inspired to write about my own journey of change after <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/stopping-work/" data-type="post" data-id="575">stopping work</a>.</p>
