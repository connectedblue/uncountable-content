<p>Another work party up at Uley Common and another volunteer joining our crew. There were three of us today, and snow covered ground greeted us when we got up there with the tools.</p>



<p>There was little point in cutting the grass as it would have been hard to rake off properly, but it was a good opportunity to cut back a sizeable scrub patch back to the line we are making with the road.</p>



<p>A mixture of bramble, blackthorn and tangled, dead branches made it tricky to clear with hand tools.  At one point, it was clear that a heavy dislodged branch would fall, so we took time to land it safely on the grass and process it for the habitat pile.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I was meeting Vicky for coffee at Prema, so took a look at the grassland on the Millennium Green which will be the target for a future work party.  It&#8217;s mostly going to be grass clearance with the brushcutter and scythes, and mostly at the top of the bank where the species rich wildflowers lay. </p>
