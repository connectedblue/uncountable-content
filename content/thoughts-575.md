<p>The last time I exchanged my labour for money was August 2019, aged 51. </p>



<p>At the time, the decision was simple, but it proved to be a pivotal moment in my life.  I felt myself burning out, and wanted to have a period doing nothing at all.  No idea how long, could have been two months or two years.  </p>



<p>I never had any trouble finding work, so I just quit.  But the company wanted me to return and suggested instead a seven month sabbatical, to which there was no downside &#8211; I would simply resign later if I wanted longer.</p>



<p>In October 2019, I joined <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> as a volunteer, simply looking for something to do outdoors.  They restore wildflower meadows across the region, which sounded pretty good.  I also started to tutor python remotely on an informal basis.</p>



<p>At this point, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that I had been pursuing <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/" data-type="post" data-id="529">an active plan for financial independence</a> since 1998. Although at the back of my mind I was mathematically aware this plan was pretty much complete, I wasn&#8217;t emotionally ready to embrace the idea of actually invoking it.</p>



<p>I liked working, in particular the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">non-financial aspects</a>. So it was my intention to return after the sabbatical. But in January 2020, I experienced something quite unexpected from far outside. I briefly became viral on LinkedIn due to my python tutoring, and an avalanche of enquiries deluged my inbox.</p>



<p>Most were pretty mundane &#8230; people chancing a request that I might want to tutor their own genius 8 year old for free.  But one or two conversations opened up the possibility that I might be able to forge a new career path doing remote consultancy on digital platforms.</p>



<p>So I contacted the company and said I wouldn&#8217;t be returning from sabbatical.  We all know what happened next &#8230; by March the country was in lockdown, by April my investment portfolio had plunged 32%, by the summer the world of work and everything else had changed forever.</p>



<p>I found clarity during the period of covid.  I gained an urgent sense that time is a depreciating asset.  My dad died aged 68, so maybe I only have 16 years left, who knows?</p>



<p>In the months after lockdown, I ditched the idea of digital consultancy. It just didn&#8217;t excite enough. I didn&#8217;t really want, or need, more money. Instead, I focussed solely on the idea of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocating time</a> however I choose.</p>



<p>Over the next couple of years, I went all out on two fronts:  nature recovery and local community projects.  Opportunity exists everywhere, and my antennae were up.  I became aware of a whole world of activities to get involved with.  In 2023, I began documenting this <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">new life in an online diary</a>.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t looked back since.  </p>
