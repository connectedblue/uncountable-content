<p>Anna from <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> had received a request for advice about a site quite near to me.  She asked me if I would pay a visit and take an initial look.</p>



<p>It was a pretty interesting site &#8211; around one hectare.  It&#8217;s unimproved grassland that has been regularly grazed, although not in the last three years or so.  I sat down with David, the land owner, who gave me a potted history and what he intends to do with the site.</p>



<p>I took a walk around the site for a closer look.  There were lots of promising areas that would naturally restore with management, and other areas that would need bigger interventions to clear rank vegetation before grassland could return.</p>



<p>A pretty interesting exercise which I wrote up in a brief report for Anna which I&#8217;ll discuss when I see her tomorrow.</p>
