<p>In reply to Jack &#8220;<a href="https://daily.baty.net/posts/2024/05/16/I-m-tired-of-all-of-us.html">I&#8217;m tired of all of us</a>&#8220;, part of the problem is that human imagination and creativity is finite.  There are only so many things to dwell on.</p>



<p>In my post on the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/finite-is-quite-large/" data-type="post" data-id="396">size of the finite possibilities</a>, I postulated a thought experiment which consisted of a video library with all possible DVDs of length three hours or less.  This is a large, but finite library.</p>



<p>This library will contain copies of a film of two humans sitting in opposite chairs discussing every possible concept that can be expressed in three hours or less.  A mind blowingly large number of DVDs, but still finite.</p>



<p>Although, in practical terms, Jack probably can find another topic that isn&#8217;t just an echo.  I&#8217;ll still be subscribing to his RSS, and look forward to a new seam of content opening up.</p>
