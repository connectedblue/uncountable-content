<p>&#8220;Did you know John Lennon got shot last night?&#8221;</p>



<p>John asked me this in the playground.  I had no idea who John Lennon was.  That was the whole topic at school that day.</p>



<p>Later in the afternoon, I caught up with the details on John Craven&#8217;s Newsround.  Apparently he was in the Beatles, who I had heard of.  We had one of their albums in the collection next to the record player.</p>



<p>I told my Dad as he walked up the road returning from work that night.  He was visibly shocked.  He knew who John Lennon was.</p>
