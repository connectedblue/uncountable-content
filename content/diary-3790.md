<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Got up early to meet the BBQ bus at Frankton at 7.25am.  There is a long coach journey around to Milford, but there were only four of us on the bus so it was quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Stopped at lots of places on the way to Milford to see some of the sites &#8211; mirror lakes, waterfalls, a huge chasm and a bush walk.  We also went through a huge 1km long tunnel through a mountain which is necessary to get to Milford.</p>
<p>Got on a boat at milford and had a 1h 45min journey around the sound.  It is really mountains sticking out of the sea vertically upwards &#8211; the tallest is around 1500 metres.  The sound is also some 300m deep, so there is no shoreline.  Very dramatic scenery and took lots of photographs.  The weather was amazing &#8211; very hot and not a cloud in the sky so you could see all the peaks.  Most days are not like this &#8211; they have around 7 metres of rainfall every year so this was very unusual.</p>
<p>We flew back in a small plane back to queenstown.  This was a good chance to see the southern alps from the air &#8211; most of which is completely inaccessible on foot.  Only 35 minutes back to queenstown rather than a 4.5 hour coach journey, so we were back in the cottage by around 5pm.</p>
<p>Had an evening meal in the local indian restaurant.</div>
