<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member Andrew1972, who has a solid plan to retire early before aged 60.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you …</h3>



<p>I am just about to turn 53.&nbsp; I have been working in the financial services industry for over 30 years in a number of roles (mostly Risk related).&nbsp; I am married and my husband and I have no children.&nbsp; To me, money provides a mechanism for experiences and funding a comfortable life.&nbsp; I want my money to work for me and when I die, I want to have spent it all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>Throughout my working career, I have always invested in my pension (I moved various funds to Interactive Investor in 2018 when I started my SIPP).&nbsp; I have also invested via an ISA over the years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your SIPP on top of a workplace pension scheme?</h3>



<p>I only have my SIPP and if an employer will not allow SIPP contributions then when I leave that employer, I will consolidate that work place scheme into my SIPP.&nbsp; I think it is much more efficient to have everything in one place.&nbsp; I like that Interactive Investor is generally a low fee provider, with all the services that I need.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>It is pretty simple, I want to accumulate enough money so that my husband and I can stop working and enjoy a happy and healthy retirement.&nbsp; As we do not have children, we plan on spending all the money we have before we die.&nbsp; If we die with assets, we did not spend enough.&nbsp; Timing this is going to be difficult, but you get the idea.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you the main financial planner in your household, and if so, how do you keep your husband up to date with your strategies? </h3>



<p>I am definitely the main financial planner.&nbsp; We generally discuss larger purchases beforehand and tend to try and stick to a monthly budget.&nbsp; I guess it comes down to having the right communication in place to ensure that we both know what commitments we have and that we plan for financial expenditure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>I am still in the accumulation phase.&nbsp; I plan on retiring in 5 years time when I turn 58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you accelerating your SIPP contributions over the next five years before retirement to accumulate as much as possible, or just keeping the regular pace?</h3>



<p>I am not actually accelerating.&nbsp; I am keeping contributions at a level that gets the maximum match from my employer.&nbsp; I am looking for the funds that I have invested to grow over the next 5 years.&nbsp; We also plan to go down to one property in retirement (we have a second home at the moment) and that will release additional funds that we can invest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>I have a spreadsheet for everything.&nbsp; Maybe I plan a little bit too much, is that possible???</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The world would be a duller place without spreadsheets.&nbsp; What are the broad indicators you’ll be looking for to support the major decision to pull the trigger and retire?</h3>



<p>I agree,&nbsp; love a spreadsheet.&nbsp; I tend to look at different return assumptions and different withdrawal amounts over time.&nbsp; I need a certain amount of comfort that the calculations are going to work before pulling the trigger.&nbsp; I guess there is no definitive answer, its a case of being comfortable that you have enough.&nbsp; If I die with loads of assets, then I would have worked for too many years.&nbsp; You have to get the balance right, but its very difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>I would consider my style to be cautious, but adventurous. &nbsp; I am 100% in stocks (apart from some funds in money market that I will need access to).&nbsp; I do not buy into the financial advisors mantra of decreasing stock exposure as you approach retirement.&nbsp; I plan on being 100% in stocks during drawdown (well except for maybe 1 year’s expenditure), why would you give up on growth for the say 20 years of drawdown.&nbsp; Also, not having children, if my pension funds run out, there is always reverse mortgaging or moving into rented retirement accommodation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp;</h3>

<li>Investors Chronicle</li>



<li>Merryn Talks Money (Bloomberg UK)</li>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I love reading about how people approach their investments and also how they change their portfolio over time and in response to market conditions.&nbsp; I think that the ii Community App is brilliant.</p>

<section class="p-and-m-summary"><article><h2>The Compounder</h2><p>My background is pretty standard really, brought up by great parents who worked really hard, not a great deal of money but they&rsquo;d bought their council house and we had new double glazed windows, we felt we were doing alright.</p><p>I had several part time jobs whilst at school and spent plenty but saved some and soon realised how easy it is for it to slip through your hands.&nbsp; It was through some of this part time work and watching my Dad work 7 days a week that I started to understand that working the hours was only part of the answer and that the other part was what job you do as well as what you do with your money.</p>
