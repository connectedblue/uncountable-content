<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member Andrew1972, who has a solid plan to retire early before aged 60.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you …</h3>



<p>I am just about to turn 53.&nbsp; I have been working in the financial services industry for over 30 years in a number of roles (mostly Risk related).&nbsp; I am married and my husband and I have no children.&nbsp; To me, money provides a mechanism for experiences and funding a comfortable life.&nbsp; I want my money to work for me and when I die, I want to have spent it all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>Throughout my working career, I have always invested in my pension (I moved various funds to Interactive Investor in 2018 when I started my SIPP).&nbsp; I have also invested via an ISA over the years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your SIPP on top of a workplace pension scheme?</h3>



<p>I only have my SIPP and if an employer will not allow SIPP contributions then when I leave that employer, I will consolidate that work place scheme into my SIPP.&nbsp; I think it is much more efficient to have everything in one place.&nbsp; I like that Interactive Investor is generally a low fee provider, with all the services that I need.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>It is pretty simple, I want to accumulate enough money so that my husband and I can stop working and enjoy a happy and healthy retirement.&nbsp; As we do not have children, we plan on spending all the money we have before we die.&nbsp; If we die with assets, we did not spend enough.&nbsp; Timing this is going to be difficult, but you get the idea.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you the main financial planner in your household, and if so, how do you keep your husband up to date with your strategies? </h3>



<p>I am definitely the main financial planner.&nbsp; We generally discuss larger purchases beforehand and tend to try and stick to a monthly budget.&nbsp; I guess it comes down to having the right communication in place to ensure that we both know what commitments we have and that we plan for financial expenditure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>I am still in the accumulation phase.&nbsp; I plan on retiring in 5 years time when I turn 58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you accelerating your SIPP contributions over the next five years before retirement to accumulate as much as possible, or just keeping the regular pace?</h3>



<p>I am not actually accelerating.&nbsp; I am keeping contributions at a level that gets the maximum match from my employer.&nbsp; I am looking for the funds that I have invested to grow over the next 5 years.&nbsp; We also plan to go down to one property in retirement (we have a second home at the moment) and that will release additional funds that we can invest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>I have a spreadsheet for everything.&nbsp; Maybe I plan a little bit too much, is that possible???</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The world would be a duller place without spreadsheets.&nbsp; What are the broad indicators you’ll be looking for to support the major decision to pull the trigger and retire?</h3>



<p>I agree,&nbsp; love a spreadsheet.&nbsp; I tend to look at different return assumptions and different withdrawal amounts over time.&nbsp; I need a certain amount of comfort that the calculations are going to work before pulling the trigger.&nbsp; I guess there is no definitive answer, its a case of being comfortable that you have enough.&nbsp; If I die with loads of assets, then I would have worked for too many years.&nbsp; You have to get the balance right, but its very difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>I would consider my style to be cautious, but adventurous. &nbsp; I am 100% in stocks (apart from some funds in money market that I will need access to).&nbsp; I do not buy into the financial advisors mantra of decreasing stock exposure as you approach retirement.&nbsp; I plan on being 100% in stocks during drawdown (well except for maybe 1 year’s expenditure), why would you give up on growth for the say 20 years of drawdown.&nbsp; Also, not having children, if my pension funds run out, there is always reverse mortgaging or moving into rented retirement accommodation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp;</h3>

<li>Investors Chronicle</li>



<li>Merryn Talks Money (Bloomberg UK)</li>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I love reading about how people approach their investments and also how they change their portfolio over time and in response to market conditions.&nbsp; I think that the ii Community App is brilliant.</p>
