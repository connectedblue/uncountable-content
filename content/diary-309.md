<p>Today I continued the task of removing the old tangled boundary hedge at <a href="https://wildacres.org.uk/">Wild Acres</a>.  The idea is to open up the whole side and then replant a native hedgerow and keep it managed.</p>



<p>A combination of rope and chainsaw allowed the dead elm to be felled which then made clearing the rest of the scrub with the brush cutter a lot easier.</p>



<p>For lunch a delicious hot spinach and potato soup with produce from the polytunnel.</p>
