<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Picked up the hire car today in Auckland &#8211; a Nissan Sunny.  Nice car to drive, except that Christopher had a few problems remembering how to start a manual car (push down clutch while turning key....)</p>
<p>Bought a satnav map for New Zealand which didn&#8217;t work straight away, and without a map so we just started driving south.  Luckily we managed to coax it into action and it found the right signal.  </p>
<p>Arrived at Kerri Downs cottage mid afternoon &#8211; a very nice couple own it and it has fantastic views over rolling hills from the terrace at the back.  It&#8217;s a one room cottage so it&#8217;s very compact, but very modern with all the facilities.</p>
