It was made from a volcanic explosion about 600 years ago and is now a conservation site.</p>
<p>We headed straight for the summit &#8211; about 240 meters above sea level.  The climb was quite gentle although the path was very shingley.  People were slipping and sliding on the way down and one lady broke her ankle and had to be helicoptered off the island.</p>
<p>It was also very hot.  Great views from the top and a nice boardwalk descent on the other side.  Walked around 2.5 hours in all which was a pretty good day.<em></em></p>
<p>Looked at the &#8216;Baches&#8217; which are historic holiday homes built before 1937 but have recently been restored.</p>
<p>Hobbled back to the apartment from the ferry &#8211; the sandals we bought had cut into our feet quite badly &#8211; they need breaking in some more and it was probably a bit too long today.  Had a quite evening as quite tired.</p>
