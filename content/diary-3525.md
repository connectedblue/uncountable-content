<p>Second day in a row for monitoring river fly.  This time at the Ebley site with Tony.  Like <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/08/sampling-sunday/" data-type="post" data-id="3516">yesterday</a>, there was a concern for what we might find after the upstream pollution event last week.</p>



<p>However, today was a woeful haul.  Even before we got onto the bank to analyse we could see there wasn&#8217;t a lot swimming around in the bucket.  We set to work, and counted the gammarus, which was very low at around 80.  But the only other species we could find was a tiny cased caddis.</p>



<p>So the overall score was a 3, which is below the trigger level for the site.  When I entered it into the system that afternoon, the system asked if we can repeat the survey in the next 48 hours.  I contacted Tony and we agreed to meet tomorrow at 8.30am and do the sample again.</p>
