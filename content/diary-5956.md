<p>Met up first thing with Maran and Graham to do the regular monthly riverfly count at the ocean.  It&#8217;s been a long while since we saw any mayfly here, and given we are now in May, I was hoping to see them today.</p>



<p>The river was very low &#8211; as low as I&#8217;ve seen it here.  It&#8217;s not rained for a while, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re due very much in the near future either.  I took the kick sample and was able to safely go across to a nice habitat in the middle of the river.</p>



<p>There were a lot of fish caught up in the sample which we had to release before getting on with the count.  You could see at first glance that the bucket was teeming with life.</p>



<p>But sadly, no mayfly.  We did have most other species though, and a large number of blue-winged olives which took the overall site score to 9 &#8211; one of the highest we&#8217;ve recorded in this spot.</p>
