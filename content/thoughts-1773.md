<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of excitement recently over <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a>, a new AI from Google that can, among other things, create an audio overview of source material in a podcast format.</p>



<p>Because I&#8217;ve made progress on my <a href="/first-archive-step">writing archive</a> recently, all my blog posts are in markdown format already. I uploaded them into the site, but immediately hit the 50 file limit. So, I concatenated them all into a single file and uploaded that instead.</p>



<p>After about five minutes, it produced this 15 minute podcast about my writing:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sep-2024-thoughts-ai-podcast.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p><em>Warning</em>:  If you do click this, the first few minutes will give you a flavour of the technology.  You won&#8217;t want to listen all the way through as it&#8217;s very much &#8220;the chris show&#8221;.</p>



<p>My first reaction was of being blown away.  I mean it does sound like a human exchange.  Some of the phrases are a little twee, and not ones I would use, but the presentation of the content was spot on.  It wasn&#8217;t misinterpreted in any way.</p>



<p>This is yet another step forward in how AI can assist the creative process.  If someone wanted to get an overview of my thoughts on money, then they could listen to this rather than wade through all my articles.  I&#8217;m perfectly fine with that.  </p>



<p>Of course, if someone then wanted to know more, they could follow up by reading my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-reading-list-for-investing/" data-type="post" data-id="769">series on investing</a> for example.  Just like they would if they wanted to follow up a topic from a real podcast.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t advertise my blog on social media, but if I did, I&#8217;d definitely use this podcast audio as a way to do so.</p>
