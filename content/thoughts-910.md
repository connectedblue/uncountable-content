<p>Yes &#8230; It is now!</p>



<p>Robert Birming <a href="https://birming.com/blog-printer-friendly/">asked this question</a> which is something I had not considered before, having not owned a printer for decades. </p>



<p>But we style for the desktop and phones.  And sometimes we even style for screenreaders to increase accessibility.  Why not style for printers too?</p>



<p>Robert included a code snippet for his blog platform, but it&#8217;s pretty generic and worked out the box on my wordpress theme.  I tweaked a couple of things, but if you now hit print preview on one of my articles, you&#8217;ll get a clean, compact layout with no navigational clutter.</p>



<p>I extended his <code>display:none;</code> selectors with an additional class called <code>.noprint</code> which can now be added to any element grouping on a post or page to hide it from the print view.</p>



<p>Printing is not just for printers.  It&#8217;s also a way to create pdf versions of your posts straight from the browser.  So it&#8217;s definitely worth a few minutes of time to spruce up your blog for this format.</p>
