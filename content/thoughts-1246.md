<p>31 August 2024 marks five years since <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/stopping-work/" data-type="post" data-id="575">I stopped work</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gPSGrpIlkc">David Bowie</a> immortalised this particular package of time, although I still think there&#8217;s different interpretations about whether he&#8217;s narrating a story now about an event that happened five years ago, or whether he&#8217;s capturing a moment of momentous change in the present and the uncertain future ahead.</p>



<p>Either way, mine is not as dramatic, but this is a good time to reflect on the journey of the last five years, and also what I&#8217;d like from the next five.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2019/08/last-day-of-work/">event itself</a> was as unremarkable as most other working days of my 29 year career. In May 2019, I handed in my notice, although that was converted to a period of seven month sabbatical starting on 1 September. That summer was spent with no plans in mind at all, I just wanted to grind out the projects I was working on and leave the decks as tidy as possible.</p>



<p>There was no send off of any sort.  My colleagues were expecting me to return, although as I walked out of the office that Friday afternoon, I did experience a feeling that my life was about to irreversibly change.  </p>



<p>In January 2020, just before COVID changed the world, I cut short my sabbatical and resigned fully.  By that point, I knew I wanted to live life a different way.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/life-after-work/">written elsewhere about this transition</a> and since early 2023, I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk">keeping a diary of my activities</a>, so there&#8217;s no need to rehash the details here.</p>



<p>The overriding feature of every single day of the last five years is I have been able to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocate time</a> exactly how I choose.  Some things I have done and not repeated, while others I tried, fell in love with and carried on.</p>



<p>This contrasts with the previous 29 years, where the choice about how to spend any particular day was heavily influenced by customers, colleagues, managers and events.  Weekends and holidays gave glimpses of what life might be like if those external forces were removed.</p>



<p>The last five years, every day has been a Saturday.  That&#8217;s about the best way to describe the experience to those in employment.  Everyone knows what a Saturday feels like.  Just an ordinary unit of time that you can allocate how you choose. </p>



<p>The first two or three years were a conscious search for <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">structure, purpose and identity</a> (three benefits you get automatically when you work). The decision to stop work is a complex and emotional one at any age. I was 51, and really felt like I wanted to traverse my fifties on my own terms. I decided to embark upon what will hopefully be my second 29 year career, focussed around community and the environment.</p>



<p>Five years in, my overwhelming feeling is gratitude. I&#8217;ve fortunately retained good health, so whatever happens in the future, I can look back on five memorable years spent as I wished. I&#8217;m grateful to the 51yo Chris for making the decision, and also to the 30yo Chris for putting the starting blocks in place for <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-60-year-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="445">a financial independence plan</a>.</p>



<p>If you are reading this, and uncertain about whether it is worth consuming less than you earn today in order to be able to allocate time however you choose later in life, then just think of it as gifting your future self.</p>



<p>We all have different amounts of money, but the same amount of time each week.  I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ve got left to live, but it&#8217;s certainly less than a year ago.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been a wild ride on the investment side of things.  You can never know the future when you decide to stop work, but my portfolio fell 32% four months later, during the covid lows of 2020.  That&#8217;s quite a sobering moment.  </p>



<p>The market recovered of course, but then we were hit with surging inflation. In the UK, the RPI has been about 34% from August 2019 to August 2024. So each pound can buy one third less than when I was working.</p>



<p>Overall though, I didn&#8217;t change my strategy. I keep a maximum of four years <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">non-discretionary spend</a> in cash and invest 100% of the remainder in index equity funds.</p>



<p>I top up the cash pot every now and then by choosing moments to sell slices of equity.  Since turning 55, I can now use my SIPP to do this which provides more flexibility and tax efficiency.</p>



<p>Every three months I do a full review of investments, spend and future forecasts. At the moment, only a mightily unexpected turn of events would mean I need to work again. But by keeping a three monthly monitor on finances, I will get early warning signs if things do start to go south.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s my five years.  And hopefully, my next five also.  </p>
