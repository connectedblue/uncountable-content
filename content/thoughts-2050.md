<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member uncountable &#8230; aka me!</p>



<p>It would be weird interviewing myself, so I&#8217;m very grateful to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/people-and-money-deltad/" data-type="post" data-id="1986">DeltaD</a> who took some time out to ask me questions about my financial journey.  So, here&#8217;s my edition of People &amp; Money&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>I’m 56 and retired in 2019, aged 51.&nbsp; I worked in a variety of technology roles in different industries, but latterly I was a data scientist for a renewable energy company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since stopping work, I have completely restructured my lifestyle around 5-6 nature recovery projects across the Cotswolds and three community projects in my local town.&nbsp; I managed to have a 29 year first career, and I’m five years into what I very much hope is a second 29 year career focused on community and conservation.</p>



<p>Time is my most valuable asset, and I want to allocate it exactly how I choose.  Saving and staying invested in the market has enabled me to do that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>My journey essentially started in 1998, aged 30.&nbsp; I became acutely aware that financial independence was not going to be bestowed upon me.&nbsp; I had some cash savings but knew that wasn’t going to be the long term answer (I had some training as an actuary in the early 90’s which gave me some mathematical tools, but not any investment insight).</p>



<p>I purchased active Fidelity funds focussed on Europe and Global.&nbsp; I’ve no idea how I landed on that &#8211; it was direct on their website.&nbsp; Then I happened to chance upon a copy of the Motley Fool book which changed everything.</p>



<p>The next year I purchased a FTSE100 acc tracker and passive investing has shaped my investing journey ever since.&nbsp; I briefly dabbled with stock picking in 2004-05, but quickly realised that I don’t possess any information that would give me an edge over any other market participant.</p>



<p>I did actually hold on to the Fidelity funds until around 2018, when I tipped the whole lot into my tracker funds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What was the best investment advice you learned that had the most positive impact on achieving your financial independence?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>It was from my friend Jean-Luc, who I worked with back in 1998.&nbsp; We are about the same age.&nbsp; </p>



<p>He read a book called Rich Dad, Poor Dad and he told me he was now looking at an investment strategy where you keep contributing and compounding until you accumulate a pot size that can meet all your outgoing expenses for the remainder of your life.</p>



<p>He then said, with a chuckle, “and when you reach that point, you stop adding”.</p>



<p>That single conversation had a profound effect on me.&nbsp; Funnily enough, I never spoke about money with Jean-Luc at all after that, over the very many years we worked together.&nbsp; </p>



<p>He might have even forgotten that brief conversation we had that day.&nbsp; Maybe I’ll send him a link to this interview to remind him.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>To enable me to put my hands on the amount of cash I need, when I need it, for every future point in my lifetime.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I’m five years into the drawdown phase and accumulated for 21 years before that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the key numbers one should always be aware of when managing our finance, pre and post drawdown?</h3>



<p><strong>Pre drawdown:&nbsp; 22x</strong></p>



<p>If your total invested portfolio is 22 times you desired annual spend, then you should be seriously considering going into drawdown.&nbsp; It’s a simple marker to judge where you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are age 40, for example, and sitting at 12x, then you’re probably in good shape with your current strategy.&nbsp; If you are in your fifties and sitting at 8x, you have quite a bit of heavy lifting to do in a short period.</p>



<p>If you have 25x, or 30x at any age, then you probably have enough.</p>



<p>You can also use it to regulate your desires.&nbsp; If you are in your mid 50’s with a pot of £650K, and a desire to spend 45K a year, then your multiple is 16x.&nbsp; Very respectable, but not quite enough to pull the trigger and enjoy allocating time on your terms.</p>



<p>If, however, you are able to live a fulfilling life with £30K index linked, then you’re suddenly at 22x and can start to think about whether financial independence is beckoning.</p>



<p><strong>Post Drawdown: 4 years</strong></p>



<p>Managing cash in drawdown is the most important activity, and keeping a number of years of expenses in cash is essential to insulate the volatility of equity markets.&nbsp; This number needs to be whatever helps you sleep at night.&nbsp; For me it’s 4 years.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>I split spend into discretionary and non-discretionary:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Non-discretionary is all the non-negotiable aspects of my desired lifestyle.&nbsp; It’s pretty much fixed in scope, although rises with inflation each year.</li>



<li>Discretionary are items where I can choose the timing and size of the spend.&nbsp; They augment my lifestyle, but doesn’t matter if I don’t have it.</li>
</ul>



<p>My target is to keep 4 years of projected non-discretionary spend (including inflation) in cash/mmf.&nbsp; This enables me to sleep at night.&nbsp; I monitor this every three months, using the actual trailing 12 months non-discretionary spend from my bank account.</p>



<p>Note that 4 years is the target.&nbsp; I’ve been as low as 1.7x in the past but I’m generally somewhere between 2.8 and 3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last time I topped up was April 2024 when I went back up to 4x.&nbsp; That was an OK point in time to do it, but clearly wasn’t the “best point” in hindsight.&nbsp; But my goal isn’t to maximise return, it’s to sleep at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would never go below 1x &#8211; that’s a red line.&nbsp; If I got down to that and the markets were still low, I’d top up by another 1x or so and then wait for things to pick up again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you the sole decision maker when it comes to household money management?</h3>



<p>Yes, for the investment strategy but no for day to day spend.&nbsp; I review the overall position every three months and go through the key metrics with my wife.&nbsp; </p>



<p>All the money is logged in a spreadsheet and passwords in a shared password manager.&nbsp; So if I suddenly wasn’t here, everything could be managed relatively easily.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>I am fully and completely committed to receiving only the guaranteed market return over the long term.&nbsp; This is because I believe that the markets will produce an average return greater than the growth of RPI over any rolling 20 year period.</p>



<p>My cashflow projections make a conservative assumption of an average annual +2.5%pa above RPI over the next 40 years.&nbsp; I have detailed ISA records from 1999, which show an average annual return of +3.9% above RPI over that period.</p>



<p>So my investment style mirrors my future cashflow needs.&nbsp; Currently I am 60% FTSE and 40% US across two accounts.</p>



<p>I’m debating whether to shift the FTSE portion to World, but I’ve not actioned that.&nbsp; I’ll only do it if I believe that FTSE is going to underperform RPI over the next 20 years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What’s your view on property vs equity market performance over the long run?</h3>



<p>I own my home, but don’t have any investment properties. &nbsp; I struggle to see how property can beat inflation over the long term, let alone equity markets.</p>



<p>I bought my house in 2005 for £325K (including stamp duty).&nbsp; If you index that by RPI since then, you get to £659K.&nbsp; Then add in the £100K I’ve spent on improving and maintaining it over the years and the present value of everything I’ve spent on the house comes to £760K.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I were to sell the house today, it would fetch £550-600K, so a real term loss on the capital value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, if it were a rental property, it would generate income.&nbsp; But I didn’t include loan costs above.&nbsp; Rental income would be netted off against mortgage interest.&nbsp; So I’d have to have generated a rental profit of £150K over a 20 year period to overall break even relative to RPI.</p>



<p>Then, of course, on a sale there is a capital gains tax to pay on the nominal increase in the value of the house, so perhaps a CGT bill of 70-80K which eats into real returns further.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible, of course.&nbsp; Many people do it.&nbsp; I just don’t know the secret sauce that makes it work.&nbsp; From what I understand, the leverage capabilities of mortgage vs deposit is where all the riches lie.&nbsp; But borrowing money on an asset that doesn’t keep pace with inflation over 20 years is not for me.</p>



<p>I’m generally a hands-off lazy investor.&nbsp; Index equity accumulation trackers are way easier for me than fixing boilers, finding tenants and chasing regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp; </h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Motley Fool Money podcast (not the website which is shocking click bait)</li>



<li>Selected Youtubers:&nbsp; Toby Newbatt, James Shack, Pete Mathews</li>



<li><a href="https://www.diyinvestor.net">https://www.diyinvestor.net</a></li>



<li>ii Community</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I’d like to hear more people talk about their long term plans for money, whether multi year accumulation plans or drawdown plans.&nbsp; The principles and strategies that go into those are much more enduring that ephemeral musings on stock picks or current tax policy.</p>
