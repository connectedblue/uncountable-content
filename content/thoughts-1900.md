<p>Inflation is the ever present bogeyman when you use wealth to support your lifestyle.  If your portfolio doesn&#8217;t grow as fast as the prices of the things you buy, that may jeopardise it&#8217;s future ability to support you as you would wish.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s critical to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/setting-investment-objectives/" data-type="post" data-id="1455">benchmark your overall investment performance</a> relative to some kind of inflation index. In the UK, there are standard published measures such as RPI which can give you an idea. However these are based on an average basket of goods, which may or may not mirror your own consumption.</p>



<p>My preference is to use a simple measure of actual personal inflation, calculated every quarter, and highlights the actual experienced price increases. I started doing this going into drawdown, and is early warning mechanism should any potential issues arise.</p>



<p>The starting point is to download 12 months of transactions from the current account. Since every single financial thing goes through this account, it includes absolutely everything. Then the process of filtering can begin.</p>



<p>First, sort the columns into &#8220;Transaction type&#8221; so similar things are grouped.  Delete any credit transactions.  Also delete any money transfers.  This reduces the list to pure spend in the last 12 months.</p>



<p>Next remove any <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">discretionary spend</a>. This is critical. You only want to measure inflation on non-discretionary spend. So, for example, if you buy a car, go on an expensive holiday or order an expensive suit, these are all things that are assessed in the moment. They don&#8217;t form your ongoing non-discretionary lifestyle expenses.</p>



<p>The easiest was to do this is to sort by descending order of value and just look at the top few. If you do happen to have a made a discretionary purchase of a Â£100 box of chocolates in a rare wild, mad moment, just leave it in &#8211; it&#8217;s not going to move the needle on anything.</p>



<p>I do include things like boiler repairs &#8211; simply because it may not be the boiler next time, but something else surely will break.  So maintenance costs should be part of non-discretionary spend.</p>



<p>Once you have done this, you have an annual view of the total non-negotiable spend for your desired lifestyle.  It&#8217;s important to have 12 months so you capture the things you do seasonally (insurance premiums, birthday treats, regular holidays etc).  </p>



<p>I record this figure at the end of every quarter. The rate of personal inflation can then be calculated by dividing this number by the number calculated on this day one year ago.</p>



<p>Here are my figures from 2022 to the time of writing:</p>

<p>You can see it&#8217;s a wild ride!  So I also use the same figure to calculate an average annual personal inflation since 2020, which was just after I stopped work.   This gives a more nuanced view useful for long term planning.</p>



<p>A couple of observations:  you can see that the high inflation experienced in the UK economy in 2023 started to work it&#8217;s way into my personal inflation in 2024.   Also, you can see that household spend reduced quite substantially in 2023 (not really sure why, to be honest) but then bounced back in 2024.  That&#8217;s why those annual figures look a bit scary!</p>



<p>But anyway, the net result is that my overall retirement lifestyle is increasing at a rate of about 7% per year at the moment, but I do expect that to trend downwards in 2025.</p>
