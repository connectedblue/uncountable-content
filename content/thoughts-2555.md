<p>During May 2025 I was the monthly host for the <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb blog carnival</a> on the subject of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-small-web-communities/">Small Web Communities</a>.  I&#8217;ve participated in a few over the last year, but this was my first time hosting.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-roundup/" data-type="post" data-id="2533">round up post</a> has got all the wonderful submissions, but I wanted to record my hosting experience without cluttering that up.</p>



<p>I have to say up front it&#8217;s been a joy to host and interact with other bloggers.  There were several who said this was their first carnival, which is great to expand with new people.  And also quite a few who I wasn&#8217;t already following in RSS who are now added to my reader.  </p>



<p>It really felt like the blog carnival itself is a small web community.  We don&#8217;t have a central place to gather, but our individual digital homes are connected by email and the monthly topic provides a common purpose. </p>



<p>A dialogue with one of the participants, <a href="https://rosipov.com/blog/looking-back-on-small-web-communities/">Ruslan</a> went even further.  It turns out, like me, he blogs about his personal finance journey.  So I <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/people-and-money-ruslan-osipov/">interviewed him for my People &amp; Money</a> series and got his insights into the challenge of preparing for early retirement in the US.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The hosting process</h3>



<p>It was pretty straightforward to host, but you do need to be a little bit organised to avoid getting in a muddle with all the submissions.</p>



<p>I put my name down around a year ago on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb wiki page</a> and put an appointment in my calendar for mid April to remind myself.</p>



<p>I scheduled the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-small-web-communities/">call for submissions post</a> to go live on 28 April, alongside my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/small-web-communities/">own submission</a>.  This post had a simple list at the end which I would update throughout the month as submissions came in.</p>



<p>I made a googlesheet to track submissions, which also became a way to generate the HTML needed to paste another <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> item onto the list.  I also found a good quote from each submission that I can use in the round up post and logged that in the googlesheet also.</p>



<p>The round up post was then pretty easy to write, and I could again produce the HTML needed for the quotes from the googlesheet, which just got pasted in.  The post was published on 3 Jun to allow for any late entries to come in.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve put my name down again for August 2026 and really look forward to doing this again.</p>
