<p>In reply to Tracy Durnell&#8217;s post &#8220;<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/03/01/indieweb-interactions-what-builds-connection/">IndieWeb interactions: what builds connection?</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the human rather than technical protocols that will drive <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/">digital biodiversity</a> on the IndieWeb.  Blog carnivals are a fabulous example &#8211; I entered my first one <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/good-enough-until-its-replaced/" data-type="post" data-id="270">earlier this month</a>. And put my name down to host one next year.  </p>



<p>No special tech required.  A simple, creative process that gave me a feeling of participation, allowed me to discover new blogs to follow in my RSS and built a small email connection with the host.</p>



<p>Starting a post on your own website with &#8220;Re: &#8221; is also a human protocol. Yes, there might be a techie thing called <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> underneath, but that&#8217;s neither mandatory nor important.</p>



<p>This protocol enables the readers of your blog to discover and connect with others.  It also reinforces that posts don&#8217;t have to project themselves as individual opinion silos.  It&#8217;s perfectly normal, and human, to build viewpoints from foundations laid by others.  </p>



<p>(A slight digression &#8211; as I write, it occurs that there&#8217;s a big difference between a reply and a reference.  This post is clearly in reply to the one made by Tracy who I&#8217;ve never connected with, and who may never read this.  But I have also referenced, through a link on my &#8220;digital biodiversity&#8221; phrase, a really important recent article on Noema.  The ideas in that article are central also building connection on the IndieWeb.)</p>



<p>Another example of an IndieWeb human protocol is the inclusion of a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/blog-roll/" data-type="post" data-id="176">blog roll</a> on your site.  We are actively encouraging our readers to click away from our work. We do it, not because we expect reciprocity, but because we know that it creates a robust and stronger digital ecosystem that is more resilient against the crushing monoculture of big tech platforms.</p>



<p>In summary, the IndieWeb will thrive because of the human protocols we develop by using it.  We don&#8217;t need a central standards body to define those protocols.  Instead, we will refine them through continuous conversations with ourselves. </p>
