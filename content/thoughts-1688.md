<p>Once you have stopped work, time suddenly becomes a central asset in  your life.  Indeed, it may even be the reward you were striving for.  There&#8217;s a good chance that spending it wisely will <a href="/what-is-happiness">increase happiness</a>, but only if you <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocate it well</a>.</p>



<p>I use an online calendar to allocate my time.  There are actually two pleasures &#8211; the first is deciding to put something in the calendar.  Only things I truly want to do go in.  The second is, of course, doing the activity itself.</p>



<p>The system works well for two reasons &#8211; firstly is that I do actually look at the calendar daily and always have a structure in my head of what the forthcoming week looks like.  And secondly because I always write an entry the moment I agree to do something.  So it&#8217;s always up to date.</p>



<p>If there are potential dates to hold for something, I&#8217;ll mark both those in. I have very few recurring appointments. <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/wild-acres/">Wild Acres</a> is one that I do almost every Tuesday. But I do book things well in advance. Most projects I&#8217;m involved with issue a schedule for the next three months dates fill quickly.</p>



<p>I also try to only book one thing per day (and sometimes an evening event, although that is rare).  Overall, this system means that I have an going structure, and since covid, there&#8217;s not been a single week when I haven&#8217;t had at least three activities per week (except holidays).</p>



<p>But among all the over commitments on the calendar, there are still runs of days when I have zero or very small appointments.  These days I look forward to as well because I don&#8217;t decide what to do right until the last minute.  And of course, some time is just spent looking at the wall.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m very careful to use the word calendar to refer to future events.  I also <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">keep a diary</a> where I document the main things I have done on certain days.  The empty calendar days usually do not get a diary entry.</p>



<p>Since stopping work in 2019, I&#8217;ve never once had the feeling of frittering away time.  Nor have I ever felt remotely like I&#8217;d prefer to be working.  And I&#8217;ve not been bored.</p>



<p>It takes some effort to manage, but I believe if you can allocate time well, you can get the most out of the remaining amount we have left.</p>
