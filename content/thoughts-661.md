<p>One of the advantages of being able to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocate your own time</a> is that you can get to have experiences that even money can&#8217;t buy.</p>



<p>The favourite part of my week is on Monday and Tuesday afternoons where I run the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> after school in the local library.  We have 8 computers and children who want to learn and explore coding book in advance and come along for free.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s really about allowing them to explore their own digital creativity.  We do Scratch, python and web programming.  There is an excellent set of project and syllabus materials <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub">on the raspberry pi website</a>, but after the children have been coming a while, they prefer to do their own thing.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t really mind what they do, whether it&#8217;s a simple program or drawing their own character.  The idea is to show them that computers can be used to create whatever is in their head.  There&#8217;s no need to just be a passive consumer of whatever the computer presents to you.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a terribly difficult thing to prepare for.  After 43 years of programming computers, I&#8217;ve amassed enough confidence to hold my own with questions from an 8 year old.  Most weeks it&#8217;s the same children returning so I get to know their strengths and preferences.</p>



<p>But the only reason I am privileged to witness this at all, is I have time to dedicate to it.  This is my journey, and I do the things I want to.</p>



<p>Your journey is very different to mine. But I&#8217;m sure that the way you allocate your time determines the enjoyment you get from yours.</p>
