<p>This post will discuss a planning model and strategy for someone well into retirement who wants to know how much of their portfolio to earmark for day to day living expenses.</p>



<p>The model is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XgwCuIpVrc5orWv0NSIMXVa8_FduVBJWv2WdJQRReDE/edit?usp=sharing">available here as a googlesheet</a> and you can download it and change the assumptions for your own purposes if you wish.  The objectives are described first below, followed by the assumptions made in the model to meet those objectives.  Finally there&#8217;s a discussion of how the model can be used to plan investment and cash flows.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Background and objectives</h3>



<p>The scenario is a male in their mid-70s who has been retired some time.  He&#8217;s in receipt of a state pension which is entirely used up by the household budget.  He has funds split across ISA and SIPP wrappers.</p>



<p>The question he would like to answer is how much of his total portfolio needs to be reserved to support a £1,000 per month withdrawal, indexed by inflation, for the remainder of his life?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Model assumptions</h3>



<p>The first set of assumptions in cells C10 to C14 are straightforward.  Put in date of birth and zero for salary and pre-retirement expenses (because he&#8217;s already retired).  So the target monthly amount is £1,000, or £12,000 per annum.</p>



<p>Next set the &#8220;draw down pot size&#8221; in cell C28 to the same value as the current accumulated pot size.  This just reflects that we are drawing down immediately &#8211; there is no more accumulation.</p>



<p>The investment and inflation assumptions are set up next.  It doesn&#8217;t matter what the absolute value of inflation is &#8211; the model outcomes don&#8217;t really alter if you move this up or down.  However, something sensible like 3% for inflation is a good baseline.</p>



<p>There are going to be around two decades of drawdown &#8211; not really short term, but not far distant either.  So I think it&#8217;s prudent to assume an average real return of +2%pa above inflation.  This reflects that some of the portfolio might be in cash or bonds, with the remainder in equity over this period.</p>



<p>Now we are ready to set the most important parameter &#8211; the multiple of target lifestle in cell C16.  This essentially is how much fund is needed today to deliver the £12kpa, indexed by inflation for a number of years.</p>



<p>When setting this value, keep an eye on the age when payments cease in cell H22.  A multiple of 15x has funds running out at age 94, whereas 17x lasts until 97.  This is obviously a personal decision, and the model is unlikely to play out exactly as planned, but for the purpose of this example, we select 16x.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Planning cash flows</h3>



<p>Using the assumptions above, the planning model suggests that £192,000 should be set aside to cover a £1,000 per month index linked drawdown for the remainder of life.</p>



<p>The actual portfolio value across ISA and SIPP could be greater than this amount.  That&#8217;s perfectly fine &#8211; it just means your funds are divided into two layers.  The drawdown layer and the discretionary layer.</p>



<p>The drawdown layer should be ring fenced, either logically in a spreadsheet, or even physically by being invested in different ways (for example, it might be a mix of bonds and index trackers to aim to deliver the +2%pa above inflation on average over the next 20 years).</p>



<p>The discretionary layer can be managed differently.  It might have some &#8220;racier&#8221; fund choices to try and eek out more return.  It might be used to fund discretionary purchases, such as house repairs or a holiday.</p>



<p>Or, the plan could be to leave it for care costs in later life, or as an inheritance.</p>



<p>Note that the SIPP portion of the fund will have some tax to pay when withrawals are made, so it might make sense to deplete the ISA side first.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusions</h3>



<p>Modelling your cash flows in this way (ie ruthlessly focussing on ability of the present values to sustain you) gives you a new way to view your portfolio.  It gives a planned purpose to a particular objective, and enables you to ring fence assets for that purpose.</p>



<p>This is much more intentional that looking at the whole thing and wanting to &#8220;maximise return&#8221; without being sure of how much you can withdraw.</p>



<p>These planning activities are not one off.  Once you have a strategy and model, you should review it every three months to make sure it&#8217;s still on track to deliver your future expectations.</p>
