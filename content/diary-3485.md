<p>A few things on my agenda today so I set out early for the regular river raft check for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  At this time of year, mink can be on the move, so we need to be vigilant.  </p>



<p>One of the rafts had clear otter prints again &#8211; I&#8217;ve been consistently seeing them for the last several months so a good sign of river health on this stretch.  The other two rafts had a few inconclusive signs, so I logged possible sightings.</p>



<p>After lunch, I headed to the library to meet Fran to discuss a recent grant we have been awarded for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  It&#8217;s a significant amount of money, and we were able to order some much needed equipment to introduce the children to different aspects of computing.  We made a parts list online, but there are a number of hurdles to cross internally with the procurement process.  It&#8217;s likely to be several weeks before equipment arrives, but we can then plan how to incorporate it into the autumn term clubs.</p>



<p>In the evening I had a call with Graham to discuss the programme for the October <a href="https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Walking Festival</a>.  I need to start building the website now as we&#8217;ll be releasing the programme at the end of the month.  I have enough to get going for the moment, but there is still quite a bit of detail to flesh out on some of the walks. </p>
