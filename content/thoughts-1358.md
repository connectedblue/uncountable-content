<p>The winter habitat season is coming to an end and we are transitioning slowly into spring.  So, I&#8217;ll be working on a variety of projects over the next few months of summer 2024:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wildflower surveys</li>



<li>Tree resurvey along the canal</li>



<li>Himalayan Balsam pulling</li>



<li>Mulching trees</li>



<li>Sowing seeds into grassland</li>



<li>Harvesting seeds</li>



<li>Start planning for the October Walking festival</li>



<li>Organise summer green drinks sessions</li>



<li>Summer term coding club after school in the library</li>



<li>Environmental land management plan for the local town</li>



<li>Plan and lead a Tree walk</li>



<li>Weekly land management at Wild Acres</li>



<li>New idea for the Artocalypse</li>
</ul>



<p>Quite a list when you write it down.  There&#8217;s plenty of other admin type activities as well, so my calendar will be pretty full.</p>



<p>You can follow along in <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a> to see how I actually get on with this list</p>
