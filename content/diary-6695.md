<p>Arranged to meet Tony a little later this morning, as I was getting my hair cut at 8am. I&#8217;m normally up early but didn&#8217;t wake until 7.15am, so everything a bit of a rush.</p>



<p>We walked over to the site in the drizzle, half expecting not to be able to go in this morning because of the very high levels.  It was indeed to fast and deep in most of the river, but we decided to try just the section near the bank.  As an extra pre-caution, I stayed on the bank with the throw line.</p>



<p>The initial glance was not too bad, and we quickly found a few samples of mayfly, cased caddis and olives.  But the striking thing was no gammarus.  Not a single one.</p>



<p>This is very, very unusual.  Usually they are in their hundreds, and even in the worst conditions we see 10-20.  But we both searched and searched and concluded there were none.</p>



<p>So that meant a trigger as the overall score was 3.  However, due to rising river levels we won&#8217;t be doing a second sample at that site to confirm.</p>



<p>On a positive note though, a lady came over and was very interested in what we were doing.  Turns out she was a teacher in Archway School, where Tony has been trying to make inroads.  So this chance encounter was very worthwhile to help build and develop this relationship to introduce riverfly to their students.</p>
