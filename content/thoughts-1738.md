<p>You often hear people talk about &#8220;mobile first&#8221; design, and there are endless opinions about what it means.  Yet I rarely hear about the <code><strong>@media</strong> <strong>only</strong> screen <strong>and</strong> (orientation: landscape)</code> CSS selector that applies when you tilt your phone to landscape.</p>



<p>Video applications like YouTube and Netflix have this instinctively built in as a way to view the movie full screen.  But most applications look pretty terrible if you accidentally tip the phone.</p>



<p>But it could be a whole new interface option for users.  The unifying messaging app Beeper utilises this mode pretty nicely.</p>
