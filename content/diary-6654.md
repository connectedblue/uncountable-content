<p>I&#8217;ve been doing Riverfly monitoring with Graham at this particular site for around two years.  Today was the first time we&#8217;ve been unable to safely access the water to carry out the survey.</p>



<p>There has been quite heavy rain over the last few days and the river levels are running high all through the catchment.  But we were still surprised when we got to our spot and find it brimming over with fast flowing water.</p>



<p>We prodded the net into the access point and it was already half a meter before you get to the deeper part.  So a pretty quick decision to abandon the monitoring for today.</p>



<p>I took a photo and recorded the fact we were unable to access on the national riverfly database.</p>
