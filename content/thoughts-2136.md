<p>I&#8217;m a bit late to seeing this, but Google are changing their Photo API at the end of March 2025 to considerably reduce the scope. They don&#8217;t want people to use it as free CDN, and they don&#8217;t want people to build apps that emulate Google Photos.</p>



<p>All fair enough &#8230; their platform, their rules.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;m now going to have to migrate away the 500+ photos which I put in a Google album to display the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/snapshots/">snapshots page in my diary</a>.  It was convenient to take a photo, add a caption and move it to that folder and it would automatically appear on my website.  My own personal instagram to record visual moments that inspire.</p>



<p>I know deep down that relying on platforms is a bad idea.  I now need to do what I should have done all along and host the photos on my own site.  </p>



<p>Steps I&#8217;ve taken so far are to download the Google Takeout for that album, and also ask ChatGPT for a script to parse the takeout file, reduce the photo size and upload them to wordpress preserving the caption and date.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll test that slowly over the next month and hopefully get everything migrated.  Next job will be to rebuild the gallery display from tagged items in the WordPress media library.  </p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like a way of getting new photos seamlessly from my phone to wordpress in future.  I don&#8217;t have any great ideas for that yet, so it&#8217;ll be a manual upload until something better comes along.</p>



<p>Once these activities are complete, I will feel better overall that I have regained control of that part of my digital life.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I&#8217;ve now completed the migration and <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/taking-back-control/" data-type="post" data-id="2372">wrote about the experience here</a>.</p>
