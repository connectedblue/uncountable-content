<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Went for a coastal walk today.  Drove down to Pukehara Bay and parked the car by the waterfront, then walked back up to the train station (quite a steep walk back up).  Then we took a train down to Plimmerton (the next stop) so we could walk back along the coast line.</p>
<p>Plimmerton is a really nice place &#8211; lots of nice houses by the sea and a village centre with some good shops.  We walked around the headland and quickly picked up the coastal path.  The whole area is pretty remote &#8211; the headland is very hilly and there are no roads.  In the middle os the path there was a shingle beach where the going got pretty tough as the path had been washed away.  We had lunch on the beach and then continued around the coast.  It got much easier once we had left the beach.  The tide was going out but we still had to scramble over rocks to get around the corners.</p>
<p>The coastline was really picturesque and the weather was superb.  All in all we were about 4 hours to walk back to the car to drive back. </div>
