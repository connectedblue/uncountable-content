<p>In response to <a href="https://css-irl.info/rss-is-good-isnt-it/">Michelle&#8217;s post</a>, RSS is jolly good indeed.</p>



<p>I honestly don&#8217;t even visit news sites like the BBC anymore.  There are over 250 RSS feeds in my reader, organised into categories and it&#8217;s very easy to digest.   Sometimes I read news, sometimes magazines, but mostly it&#8217;s other blogs.  Real posts written by real people.</p>
