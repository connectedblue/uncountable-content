<p>I&#8217;ve started a new series of interviews on my blog.  I interview people about their approach to money and how they utilise it to support their lifestyle.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="/topic/people-and-money/">People &amp; Money</a> and the hope is that other people will be inspired to think about their own financial journey a bit more when they read the stories from other ordinary people.</p>



<p>I <a href="/thoughts-on/money/">write about money</a> quite often on this blog because I don&#8217;t think there is enough public discussion about this thing that everyone needs.  Financial literacy is woefully low and, in the UK at least, large swathes of the population are not making any meaningful plans to fund their lifestyles after they stop working.</p>



<p>In case this title seems a little familiar, I also need to give a hat tip to <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manu</a> who inspired both the format and title of this project.  His People &amp; Blogs series is one of the weekly must reads on the independent web.</p>



<p>If you have an intentional approach to money, I&#8217;d love to interview you for this series.  Finance is such a personal thing, and literally everyone does it differently.  Although you might think your approach is nothing special, telling your story will provide a spark to inspire someone else to re-think their own approach.</p>



<p>To be part of this journey, send me an email on <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a>.  It&#8217;s over email, and will be anonymous unless you want to be linked to your online profile.  I send you an initial set of questions.  When I&#8217;ve read your initial response, I send some more to dive in a bit deeper. </p>
