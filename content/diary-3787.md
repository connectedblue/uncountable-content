<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Decided to do a driving trip around the Otago peninsula today.</p>
<p>The main thing to see was Lanarch castle which was built by a local business man around 140 years ago.  It fell into disrepair and a local couple bought it for restoration in 1967.  The gardens and castle were really good and we spent a good three hours walking around.</p>
<p>Afterwards we went to a marine aquarium which was part of the university.  Lots of different types of fish including sharks.  Drove back to the cottage afterwards through lots of fog and mist &#8211; seems to be a feature of this whole area.  </p>
<p>At night we light the wood fire as there was quite a chill &#8211; first time anywhere so far that its been cold at night.</div>
