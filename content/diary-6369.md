<p>Today was expected to be the last when Ruth would lead the <a href="https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/">Stroud Valleys Project</a> habitat management along the canal.  Plus it was Mike and Neil&#8217;s birthday so a social get together was planned at Fromebridge Mill to mark the date.</p>



<p>As it happens, Ruth has been extended until the end of October which is excellent news for the group. Around 20 of us gathered in the upstairs room for a really excellent buffet laid on by Mike and Neil. This team of people is just the best to be part of, and it was great to catch up with everyone for a couple of hours.</p>



<p>We had formed a separate whatsapp group to sort out some gifts for Mike, Neil and Ruth.  Sadly Lisa, who had done a lot of the gift organising, wasn&#8217;t able to make it today, but we all finally got to see what was purchased.</p>



<p>Outside the mill is a weir, but for the first time in the last four years I&#8217;ve been coming here, the weir wasn&#8217;t there.  The river is so low, it&#8217;s trapped behind and the only water passing through was the fish pass.</p>



<p>We need lots of rain very soon.</p>
