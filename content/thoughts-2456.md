<p>I made my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/us-and-uk-portfolio-allocation/" data-type="post" data-id="1878">last portfolio strategy change in 2022</a>, when I shifted from 100% FTSE 100 to 60:40 UK:US. </p>



<p>At the time, I reset book values back to 0% so I can compare the relative performance of the change. This means I can see the effect of moving to the US versus carrying on as before.</p>



<p>At the time of writing in May 2025,  the gains are +29.4% FTSE 100 and +34.7% US. So there&#8217;s clear blue water to give me confidence that the change in strategy is bedding in nicely.</p>



<p>As always, you can&#8217;t look at total return in isolation. RPI over that period has been +17.3%. My <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/" data-type="post" data-id="289">long term model</a> assumes a long term, average annual real total return of +2%pa above RPI.</p>



<p>Three years is way too short a period to measure the progress of that assumption under the new strategy, but again, I&#8217;m happy that progress so far is giving no cause for concern.</p>



<p>These relative return gaps have been volatile over the period. Just after I started (a few months before the Truss budget) the figures were +4% UK/-3% US and earlier this year, they stood at +25% UK/+48% US just before the US sell offs after the Trump tariff annoucements.</p>



<p>I intend to let this strategy change bed in for at least another 10-15 years, before deciding whether another strategic review is required. By then I will be around 70, and my time horizon will be much shorter than today. I&#8217;ll also be looking to simplify <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">my withdrawal strategy</a> to suit my cash flow needs at that time.</p>
