<p>Hedy has <a href="https://hedy.bearblog.dev/on-ideal-feeds/">surveyed the feed landscape</a> from a functional and outcome perspective which sums up the ecosystem nicely.  And the broad conclusion is there is no ideal feed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--7">
<p>After breaking it all down, it&#8217;s become clear to me that there is no obvious winner, nor loser.</p>



<p>For those who consume feeds for the purpose of entertainment and occasionally serendipitous discovery, I can&#8217;t seem to argue purely for personal feeds against the algorithmic feed &#8212; as is the trend of the population that defend an open web and against modern social media.</p>



<p>Letting a few individuals of your selection determine the kind of content you see doesn&#8217;t seem to be such a good idea.</p>



<p>The best way to go, then, is to have a mix of everything. But why? And is it really productive to make these clear distinctions between the kinds of feeds like I did above regarding the author of the content and how judgement is passed?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I think a lot about these topics in regard to my own digital consumption.  I&#8217;ve given up on social media, for both publishing and consuming, but I still want to feel part of a community and satisfy my overall curiousity.</p>



<p>I keep a category in my newsreader called &#8220;hosepipes&#8221; which contains three feeds at the moment:  the bear blog feed, the smol.pub feed and the excellent <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/blog-roll-club/" data-type="post" data-id="1622">blogroll club feed from Lou and Jedda</a>.  These posts would be too overwhelming for my main feed, but every now and then I purposefully go and drink from the hosepipe.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how I discovered Hedy&#8217;s blog, who I&#8217;ve now added to my reader (and has some excellent other blog posts).  </p>



<p>I &#8220;starred&#8221; the article, so that it appears in my favourites.  The most recent two articles in this list appear in the footer of my posts for RSS subscribers (part of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1156">an experiment</a> to see how  ideas can spread).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also written this reply post, to build on the conversation.  Others may or may not join in.  And I&#8217;ll drop a quick email of apprecation.  These are all part of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/human-protocols/" data-type="post" data-id="497">the human protocols</a> that we layer on top of the platform feeds.</p>



<p>I agree with Hedy that everything is an algorithm, and we can ultimately combine external algorithms with filters of our own to help curate our digital experience.</p>
