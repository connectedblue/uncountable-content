<p>I&#8217;ve been working with Gloucestershire libraries on a programme called Space to Create which is a series of digital &#8220;boot camps&#8221; aimed at young people who want to further their skills in this area.  It&#8217;s particularly aimed at 16-24 year olds who are not in education, training or employment.</p>



<p>Today was the first session of the programme.  I designed a course around creating an online shop using wordpress and woocommerce.  It&#8217;s a bit of an experiment, but my aim was to start them with a clean install and get them to customise it into a site that meets the brief.</p>



<p>The course took place in the new library at Stroud which is the first time I had visited.  It&#8217;s really a first class facility and we held the course in the very well equipped innovation lab.</p>



<p>Three people signed up for the course, so we were able to take a focussed three hours in getting them to understand the principles of web design, and also start using the software. We have some online and in person sessions planned over the next six weeks or so which will help them develop the project to a point where it can be showcased.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also like to have the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> have a bus trip up to the lab so the children can use the equipment there.  We discussed a bit of funding, which is available, but there is still quite of bit of logistics to sort out with such a trip.  I&#8217;ve got some meetings coming up with the library to try and progress this for next year.</p>
