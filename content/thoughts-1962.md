<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member NOV24, who started investing at age 21, and now has sights firmly set on financial independence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>I live in South West London, and work in the media industry. I see money as a powerful tool for freedom – it’s not just about accumulating wealth, but about creating choices and flexibility in my life. </p>



<p>For me, financial independence means the ability to live life on my own terms, whether that’s pursuing my passions, seizing new opportunities, or simply having the freedom to make decisions without being constrained by financial worries. It’s all about finding that balance between security and the freedom to shape my own future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>I started investing at the age of 21, but at the time, I had little understanding of financial markets. To get started, I used a wealth management company that created a portfolio for me, primarily made up of UK shares. I opted for their advisory service, not the discretionary management service, so the portfolio was left to its own devices over the years. As you can imagine, some investments performed well while others didn’t, and the portfolio became increasingly unbalanced.</p>



<p>For a long time, I was completely disengaged from investing and didn’t take much interest in it. However, in 2018, I decided to part ways with that wealth management company after their fees skyrocketed. I opened my own ii account and began taking control of my investments. I started reading books on investing and was amazed by how simple and straightforward it could be. Looking back, I realized I would have been in a much better financial position if I had invested in a global stock market tracker fund instead of relying on the wealth management company.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You were very foresighted to start investing so early.&nbsp; What was the rough % of your take home pay that you invested in those early days?&nbsp; When did you start pension contributions?</h3>



<p>Actually, it was 0%. I didn’t start working until I was around 24, and I didn’t invest any of my income during my 20s. Instead, I was given a lump sum at 21 and invested all of that. I didn’t start contributing to a SIPP until 2018.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>My goal with money is to grow my wealth as much as possible while minimizing tax liabilities. I believe that capital gains and taxes on dividends are excessive and unfair, and should be reexamined. </p>



<p>Ultimately, I aim to achieve financial independence so I can live life on my terms—doing what I want, when I want, without being constrained by financial concerns. </p>



<p>Currently, 20% of my portfolio is in a trading account, so I actively manage it to stay within the capital gains allowance each year. It’s really frustrating having to pay tax on dividends, but I’m focused on optimizing my strategy to minimize this impact.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You have a reasonably high percentage outside ISA.&nbsp; Do you find yourself making different fund or stock selections when you know you have tax to pay on returns?</h3>



<p>I try to avoid investing in that account for exactly those reasons. My focus is on gradually moving these investments into my ISA and SIPP instead.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?</h3>



<p>I’m currently in the accumulation phase, with anywhere from 16 to 28 years until retirement. I haven’t fixed a specific retirement age yet, but I’m open to the possibility of retiring sooner. Ultimately, I’m focused on building wealth now to give myself the flexibility and options to make that decision when the time comes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the broad indicators you would be looking for to have confidence that you have reached financial independence?</h3>



<p>That’s a good question, but I haven’t given it much thought yet. It’s something I’ll probably explore more seriously when I turn 50, as it feels a bit early to be considering it now.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>My investing style is a mix of funds, ETFs, and individual stocks. While most of my portfolio is in funds and ETFs, I really enjoy picking stocks myself. I believe it&#8217;s important to remove emotion from the process—cutting losses quickly and holding on to the winners. Of course, that’s easier said than done! I’ve made my share of mistakes, but I’m always learning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the best stock winner you picked?&nbsp; And worst loser?</h3>



<p>The Sage Group was probably my best-performing pick. On the other hand, Just Eat was one of my biggest losers—thankfully, I sold it a while ago.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp;</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Money week&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shares magazine&nbsp;</li>



<li>finimize newsletter&nbsp;</li>



<li>Podcasts: motley fool money, behind the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I’d love to hear about other people’s experiences with stock picking—do they follow specific rules for taking profits, and if so, how much? Do they hold onto their losing stocks for a set period or prefer to sell them quickly?</p>
