<p>JRN posted about their methodology for finding <a href="https://jrn.sh/post/how-i-find-interesting-blogs">interesting new content</a> and whether people really add from blog directories.</p>



<p>As it happens, I discovered their blog through the new entry RSS feed for <a href="https://blogroll.club/">blogroll.club</a> .  I saw the site, liked the content and added it to my reader.  Then I saw that post and felt I had to respond!</p>



<p>I wrote about the feeds that <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/blog-roll-club/" data-type="post" data-id="1622">Lou and Jedda offer</a> a couple of weeks back.  They have enhanced the blog directory concept by offering dynamic feeds in addition to the static list.  This morning I saw their update post on new blogs added, checked them out and updated my reader.</p>



<p>I also put their <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/stream/user/1005111300/tag/A%20Blogroll">aggregated feed</a> into a separate category called Hosepipes in my reader.  This is essentially every post in their directory that has been published recently.  I hide this from my main feed, otherwise it would dominate (and it also contains duplicates of many posts I follow anyway).  But that category is useful to go into from time to time and discover a new blog to follow.</p>



<p>I do agree with JRN in general though, that people are not trawling through alphabetic directory lists looking for new stuff.  Mostly I add new sources when I stumble across links in other blogs.  This kind of contextual cross linking remains the most powerful discovery mechanism we have on the independent web.</p>



<p>There is still a lot of innovation to be made in search and discovery outside of algorithmic tech giants.  Jedda and Lou have made a nice step forward in enriching that ecosystem.</p>
