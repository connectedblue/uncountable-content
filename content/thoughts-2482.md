<p>I have <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/modelling-your-financial-future/" data-type="post" data-id="2185">released the tool</a> I use to model my net current assets in order to see how well they cover my expected future cash outflows.  One key input variable is the <code>Non-discretionary lifestyle fund multiple</code>.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not immediately obvious what this is, but it&#8217;s critical to understanding the coverage of your assets.  So this post will breakdown the concept, and allow you to input the correct value.  </p>



<p>At this point, it&#8217;s worth noting that you don&#8217;t need to input it manually if you use the googlesheets version of the model.  Simply press <code>calculate plan</code> and the tool will work out the appropriate value for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An analogy</h3>



<p>Before we dive in, let&#8217;s warm up with an analogous value that most people are familiar with.  </p>



<p>The so-called &#8220;4% rule&#8221; means that you withdraw 4% of the value of your fund at retirement, and then increase that base amount by RPI each year and you&#8217;ll never run out of money.  </p>



<p>Another way of expressing this is that you need a fund of 25x your annual expenses in order to retire.  This could be called a &#8220;Lifestyle fund multiple&#8221; of 25.</p>



<p>My spreadsheet model has got nothing to do with the 4% rule, which is flawed from many angles (not least it takes no account of state pension).  However we do need a multiple of some sort in order to divide the assets into the three key layers:  Tax reserve, non-discretionary lifestyle fund and discretionary lifestyle fund.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discretionary vs non-discretionary spend</h3>



<p>I have a separate post which <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">goes into this in some detail</a>, but in essence, non-discretionary expenses consists of all those things that are non-negotiable in your lifestyle.</p>



<p>So as well as the obvious food, energy, clothing etc, you need all the other elements that you consider part and parcel of your retirement.  If you have 3 foreign holidays, add that in.  If you dine out once a week, add that in.  If you want to be woken each morning at 6am by a bagpiper in full highland dress, add that in.</p>



<p>The important thing for the model is that this spend stays constant in real terms.  So you can&#8217;t just suddenly decide in 5 years to have 6 foreign holidays a year.  What you&#8217;d have to do is maybe ditch the highland bagpiper and spend the savings on the holidays instead.</p>



<p>(Note that you could decide in one particular year to have 6 foreign holidays and fund the extra three from your available discretionary funds. Doing so does not impact your non-discretionary fund).</p>



<p><a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/estimating-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="779">Estimating your non-discretionary annual lifestyle spend</a>  accurately is absolutely critical to modelling your financial future.  You need to spend as much time as possible getting this value, in today&#8217;s money.</p>



<p>A quick note on discretionary spend for completeness, but we won&#8217;t dwell on it.  Discretionary spend is where you can decide both the amount and the timing, but critically, spending it does not impact the ability for you to enjoy all the non-negotiable aspects of your lifestyle.</p>



<p>So, in the example above, you could decide one year that two of the three holidays will be upgraded to business class travel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Non-discretionary Lifestyle fund</h2>



<p>The final piece of the puzzle before we get onto the multiple itself is the total fund which you set aside to cover the non-negotiable aspects of your lifestyle.</p>



<p>This fund has a very specific job.  It is forward looking, using assumptions like age at death, investment return, state pension and other things which you need to make conservative estimates for.</p>



<p>The fund should be pretty much zero on the death of the second partner if all the assumptions play out in practice.  </p>



<p>This is critical, so I&#8217;ll repeat again:  The non-discretionary lifestyle fund should be planned to go to zero by the time you die.  Its only job is to sustain your household lifestyle until life is no more.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not designed to be passed on (although of course, you can hold other assets outside this fund which can be passed to heirs).</p>



<p>This fund value is so important to financial outcomes, that I recalculate it every quarter, using up to date estimates of non-discretionary lifestyle spend and reviewing all assumptions.  The spreadsheet model does exactly this task. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Non-discretionary Lifestyle fund multiple</h3>



<p>Finally, we can now get to this key assumption.  The total lifestyle fund is your current annual non-discretionary expenses multiplied by the <code>non-discretionary fund multiple</code>.</p>



<p>In other words, this multiple &#8220;bakes in&#8221; all the future assumptions about age at death, future inflation, future returns, state pension etc and boils it down to a simple number.</p>



<p>The spreadsheet model helps you calculate this input number.  Once you have entered all the other assumptions, press &#8220;calculate plan&#8221; and the appropriate number will be worked out that leaves you with as close to zero as possible on the second death.</p>



<p>If you are using excel, you&#8217;ll have to do this manually.  Just start with a value of say 15 and then slowly increase or decrease it as directed by the spreadsheet until the full plan is revealed.  That is your final value for this multiple.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rules of thumb</h3>



<p>As flawed as the 4% rule is, it does provide a rough rule of thumb in the absence of any other information.  Similarly, there are rules of thumb that can be applied to the non-discretionary lifestyle multiple.</p>



<p>A couple in their mid fifties expecting two full state pensions should have a multiple of around 20.</p>



<p>So if you are say 54 and contemplating a retirement with total non-discretionary household income of £50,000, then you will need a non-discretionary reserve of around £1m.</p>



<p>Or, you can work backwards.   If you have a total pot of £1.2m, and set aside £100K for future taxes and £300K for discretionary items and possibly money for heirs, then you have a non-discretionary fund of £800K.<br><br>Dividing this by 20 (assuming this is your calculated multiple for your assumptions).  This gives a non-discretionary spend of £40,000pa in real terms.</p>



<p>You then have a choice, either trim back your desires to squeeze within £40K and retire today, or carry on working until your fund is big enough to match your desires.</p>



<p>So, as you can see, this value is rather critical to making sense of your financial future.  Please note that this is not a &#8220;standard&#8221; approach to retirement calculations.  It is something which I use and works for me.</p>



<p>If you think it might work for you then great.  But if you don&#8217;t understand it, then please don&#8217;t use it.  Refer instead to some standard retirement planning texts.</p>
