<p>First task of the day was to complete the small mammal raft checks for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  On the way to the sites, there was a wall of birdsong, where I picked up Song thrush, blackcap, greenfinch, chiffchaff, wren and blackbird all competing.</p>



<p>Although we&#8217;ve had little rain in the last fortnight, there were no signs present on either raft (sometimes they get washed away).  So just a reset of the cartridge to see what happens in the next fortnight.</p>



<p>The next appointment was with Mike to discuss and co-ordinate all the various river related activities in the local area.  He is the GWT community representative, but also takes part in <a href="https://dursleygreen.org.uk/dursley-green-drinks/">Dursley Green Drinks</a>, where there has been a particular community interest over the last year or so.</p>



<p>The main activities are riverfly, water quality testing and water guardians, but there are also a few other habitat and outflow mapping exercises that could be done.  I think there&#8217;s a case to use the <a href="https://dursleygreen.org.uk/dursley-green-drinks/">Dursley Green Drinks</a> to start to put together coherent information about the different things, and act as a point of co-ordination for anyone who wants to get involved.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a slow burn thing, but definitely a good idea to get together and swap notes.</p>
