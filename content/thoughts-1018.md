<p>John at <a href="https://disassociated.com/">disassociated</a> raised a question close to my heart when he <a href="https://disassociated.com/linkedin-professional-network-blogging-platform/">questioned if LinkedIn is a professional network or blogging platform</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--17">
<p>“But, being on LinkedIn makes networking with likeminded people easier,” replied the Twitter member (in words to that effect). He may have been right. If there were enough likeminded people there, perhaps someone could generate a few leads. But, I don’t know. LinkedIn is LinkedIn. It’s not for everyone. But then again, LinkedIn could almost be considered a blogging platform. All you need do is figure out LinkedIn-speak, which includes talking yourself up, way up, and you’re set.</p>

<p>I was very active on LinkedIn from 2018-2022, when I froze my account because it was consuming too much time.  I recently <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/freezing-linkedin-again/" data-type="post" data-id="727">briefly returned though</a> to pick up my old posts.  I want to load the 700 or so posts I made into this blog so I have a single record of my writing.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t really give a second thought before to those posts trapped in the LinkedIn deep freeze.  But after writing on this site for a couple of months, I realised that what I was doing on LinkedIn was blogging.  So I had an urge to get my &#8220;blog posts&#8221; back.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t using LinkedIn for professional purposes &#8211; I stopped work in 2019.  But I was definitely writing for audience engagement.  I knew what topics, buttons, phrases would get people to react and I got a lot of comments as a result.</p>



<p>Like John, I won&#8217;t be returning to LinkedIn.  This is my digital home now, and shaping it as I please is way more important than feeding an algorithm.</p>
