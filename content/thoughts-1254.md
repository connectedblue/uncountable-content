<p><em>This post is part of an <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/princeton-companion-to-mathematics/">ongoing reading project</a> where I am working through the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</em></p>
<p>While browsing the Blaugust feed, I noticed a post from JJxsly on <a href="https://jjxsly.bearblog.dev/princeton-companion-to-math-draft-outline-of-main-branches/">the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--29">
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/PCMMainBranchOutline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCMMainBranchOutline</a> is pulled from the Princeton Companion to Mathematics<sup><a href="https://jjxsly.bearblog.dev/princeton-companion-to-math-draft-outline-of-main-branches/#fn-1">1</a></sup> and is a brief mind map of the main branches of the subject that the author(s) deemed important. Even though I am just starting to get into it, the PCM seems like an awesome book to return to periodically for someone interested in math.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This book is exactly the kind of book I crave.  Before going to university in 1987, I acquired a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Experience">The Mathematical Experience</a> which I devoured.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m really just an interested amateur, but from the book description, I think I&#8217;m going to be similarly gorging on this, although it will probably take me a lot longer to digest the complexities of the articles.</p>



<p>Well worth £65 from Amazon</p>
