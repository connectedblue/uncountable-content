<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member MJL, who has been executing an extremely focussed strategy for 25 years, resulting in early retirement and enjoyment of life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>I got my degree and PhD in Engineering from Oxford, spent 20 years in global manufacturing roles in FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 companies up to global VP level, then for the last 6 years worked at a Russell Group University, advising on commercialisation as a Professor of Practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have just retired at 52 (actually down to a 1% contract &#8211; see later). My husband is 58 and retires in 3 months. We have two kids; one in their 2nd year at Uni and the other going to Uni later this year.</p>



<p>My attitude to money was shaped by my upbringing which was largely to focus on education and work hard to earn decent amounts, spend less than you earn and invest the rest. This can then buy you options and time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My Dad has invested (sensibly) in the markets for &gt;50 years (and retired at 57) and this, along with working for publicly listed companies with a clear focus on delivering shareholder value, made me quite comfortable with investing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also think my PhD and years in technology development/experimentation make me ok with trying/testing different investments and approaches as long as the risk is within my tolerance. Not every trial works but you will learn something.</p>



<p>I manage the investments in our household &#8211; I&#8217;m just more interested than my husband &#8211; and the approach I outline below is mirrored on my husband&#8217;s side and we view our portfolios (investments/pensions) in the round.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>I first invested via ISAs in my late 20s (PEPs back then) and have maxed out contributions most years since and we did the same with Child Trust Funds for both kids. We have also prioritised pension contributions. For most of my career, I was fortunate to receive annual bonuses and several step-change pay rises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we never really increased our outgoings significantly (unlike colleagues who massively inflated their expenses via second homes, first class long haul holidays, sports cars etc etc) &#8211; that said we have lived well and I&#8217;m not a fan of the FIRE movement personally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach has meant we had excess income which we used to pay off our mortgage &gt;10 years ago and invest tax efficiently for &gt;25 years.&nbsp; We did have an IFA for around 15 years and was happy with them, but moved away 6 months ago as comfortable I can do this myself now (and have the time).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were particularly helpful when I had a redundancy pay-off to invest and also when I transferred my DB pension. The pension transfer is an emotive topic, but was good for me. The &#8216;risk&#8217; was offset by my husband having a DB pension and the timing (end of 2016 when transfer values were high) and has been a key enabler of early retirement due to the flexibility of a SIPP.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What were the main investing influences you got from your Dad?</h3>



<p>To keep it simple and exploit drip-feeding, diversification and compounding. He also normalised investing in the market (many people are nervous about this without realising that their pensions are all invested). He is quite proud of the fact that he pretty much reverses the advice to have (100-your age)% in equities vs fixed income. He&#8217;s 87 and c80% in equities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>To have sufficient that I can choose how to spend my time, have set up our kids well (funds for university and potential house deposit) and don&#8217;t need to budget very carefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am not interested in trying to &#8216;beat the market&#8217; and chase returns. I am very happy with reasonable returns as I rely on compounding to do most of the work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I&#8217;m transitioning to drawdown after 25 years in accumulation. Leading up to retirement, I started investing in dividend paying funds and then stopped re-investing ISA dividends 12 months ago and paid these into my bank savings account to start building a cash reserve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now in retirement, as I&#8217;m 52, I will use ISA and VCT dividends plus sale of funds from my GIA (within CGT allowance) to bridge until I can access my SIPP at 55. Excess sales from my GIA will go into topping up my ISA (not accumulating, but improving tax efficiency).</p>



<p>On my glide path to retirement, I have transitioned work over the last 6 years. I have gone from a very full-on global role in a large corporate, to the University role 15 mins down the road with no travel. Then over the last 3 years, have gone from 5 days to 3 days to 2 days and now 1%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 1% contract means I stay as an advisor, but can scale up if needed/written into a grant/want to, on an interesting project. This feels a good entry to an early retirement as again I have options. The gradual change to work has enabled me to build up my non-work interests/activities and avoids the sudden stop which many comment can leave you feeling a little lost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>Pre-retirement, I used our IFA to map a cash flow forecast from our planned retirement age out to 100 and stress test it with several scenarios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first key question to answer was &#8216;how much do you want to have to spend?&#8217;. To answer this, I ran a bottom up and top down analysis &#8211; bottom up, going through main line items of spend and working out our annual bill&#8230;then top down looking at our annual income minus ISA/CTF investments to see what we were spending in total.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This indicated a rough annual expenses amount. I then inflated this by 20% as with not working, I knew we&#8217;d spend more e.g. on travel, and wanted a good margin of error so I wouldn&#8217;t have to budget in-year too carefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I look at larger items, such as buying a camper van, separately and these will be funded by ISA top-slicing.</p>



<p>We are not having to budget for the kids Uni fees (tuition plus maintenance) due to 18 years of CTF investment. This means they are in a position to fund maintenance costs (accommodation/living expenses) via dividends and top-slicing of their now ISA. For tuition fees, we are reviewing on an annual basis whether to take the loan or them pay out of their ISA, based on interest rate (set each March and based on RPI, with a cap) vs what we believe we can achieve in returns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the 2023/24 academic year for example, we took out the loan as the interest rate was around 7.3% and the market was looking well (return from the ISA ended up being &gt;15%). In 2024/25 the interest rate is 4.3% and again we took out the loan and kept the money invested in the ISA&#8230;am hoping the market will recover(!)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How does ISA top-slicing work?</h3>



<p>Identifying the funds that have grown the most and selling off some of the growth portion to realise income but maintain the capital.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What’s your children’s interest in managing money and have you been able to influence their approach?</h3>



<p>Our daughter budgets very well within her means but is not interested in investing currently (apart from exploring the ethical nature of different investments), seeing the CTF as our money and wanting to earn her own. Fair enough. </p>



<p>Our son is interested in learning about investing and already understands far more than me at his age. He has the benefit of already seeing 18 years of investment history for his CTF and can put the current market volatility into context vs the 2008 and Covid dips, so gets the notion of &#8216;keep invested and be patient&#8217;.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>Mostly passive and very patient. A fan of pound-cost averaging. Always funds vs individual shares.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some satellite investments as experiments, but most of my returns have come from simply being in the market for a good amount of time vs anything more sophisticated.</p>



<p>I have been at risk of letting the tax tail wag the dog e.g. VCT investments. In hindsight I wouldn&#8217;t do this again (risky and not so straightforward to come out of). Slow and simple works for me.</p>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you planning any major changes to your investment strategy now that you’re in retirement, either immediately or in the years to SPA?</h3>



<p>No major changes &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to keep 80% in equities. The drawdown income sources and balance will adjust once I can access the SIPP and then when some DB pensions and the State Pension (if still around!) start. </p>



<p>The only change in approach, following the October budget and pensions/IHT, is that I plan to use more of my SIPP vs retain for passing on. However, I expect many more changes to come and so will keep an open mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money? </h3>



<p>I read articles from the Sunday Times Money/FT, enjoy reading opinions/suggested links from the ii app community.</p>



<p>I have appreciated several books e.g. The Psychology of Money, How to Retire, Rich Dad Poor Dad and have just bought A Random Walk Down Wall Street.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I like hearing about drawdown strategies (recent discussions have prompted me to look into level of cash reserves, MMFs, recycling from SIPP into ISA). </p>



<p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the group that are active traders and look at what they&#8217;re doing but won&#8217;t be joining them.</p>

<section class="p-and-m-summary"><article><h2>Deflationary boom</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a 45 year old ex-fund manager. People would always mis-hear my profession as &lsquo;Fun manager&rsquo; or &lsquo;Farm manager&rsquo; in a desperate attempt to latch on to something that a) they could understand and b) didn&rsquo;t bore them senseless. I didn&rsquo;t find being a Fund Manager boring but it was very stressful and after twenty years of it I burnt out. I am now a Farm Manager.</p>
