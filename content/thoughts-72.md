<p>I have a system in Evernote to <a href="http://justmythoughtsaloud.com/2012/12/29/remembering-things/">keep track of all the things I need to do</a> on a daily basis.  My &#8220;Next Actions&#8221; list is great as it allows me to prioritise constantly &#8211; it usually doesn&#8217;t matter if an item is done today or tomorrow, as long as it&#8217;s done soon (there&#8217;s a separate &#8220;someday/maybe&#8221; list for things in the medium term).  As long as you remember to check the list frequently, and check things off when they&#8217;re done it&#8217;s a great system.</p>
<p>But there are occasions that I need to be prodded constantly, especially for recurring items.  For example, I have to file and pay a VAT return every quarter.  Evernote is a bit cumbersome for repeated events.  And sometimes I just need a note in my mail to remind me that a report is due on friday.</p>
<p>So alongside Evernote, I use google calendar to manage deadlines.  Mixing them in with regular appointments quickly causes confusion.  The alert requirements are also different &#8211; a pop up reminder 15 minutes in advance is usually what you want for an appointment, but that&#8217;s no good at all for a major deadline.  </p>
<p>But a little advance set up makes everything much simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a separate calendar called &#8220;Hard Deadlines&#8221; (on your google calendar page you find this about one third down on the left under the My Calendars menu.</li>
<li>In the settings for this new calendar, set the default reminder methods for entries to be whatever you want.  There can be multiple reminders using pop-ups or email or both.  I have an email reminder a week in advance and then three, two and one days beforehand.</li>
<li>I also set up a daily agenda to be emailed at 5am with all the deadlines for that day.  No email is sent if there aren&#8217;t any.</li>
<li>Recurring items can be set up very easily in google calendar so these are set up once.  I use the &#8220;All day&#8221; option for all deadlines rather than specify a particular time.  </li>
<li>Individual deadlines are set as required.  There is a great way to automatically integrate Evernote and google calendar, but this will be the topic of a future blog post.</li>
<li>The Agenda view gives you a good forward view of all looming deadlines over the next few weeks</li>
<li>Individual reminders can be switched off if you&#8217;ve done it and don&#8217;t want to be reminded any more.  Or if something needs extra prodding over the default, additional reminders can be added to those deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once set up, you can choose to view all your calendars together if you want, or if it gets confusing you can hide appointments.  I like having an email reminder and I can always create an item in my Evernote to-do list as well to track it. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now &#8230; I&#8217;ve got some things to do &#8230;.</p>
