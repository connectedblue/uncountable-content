<p>I don&#8217;t run the regular <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> during school holidays, but I decided to hold three one off events in the library to support the library summer challenge.</p>



<p>The theme this year is sport, so I held a 1.5 hour class on building a two page sport website from scratch.  The children ranged from age 9 to 13 and had never done web coding before.  All eight PC workstations were filled.</p>



<p>I was very pleased with the outcome.  They all had a favourite sport, wrote some text on it, included some youtube videos and images and changed some colours on the page.  </p>



<p>It was all in raw HTML and CSS, so a lot of typing involved.  But that didn&#8217;t put them off at all, and I think they were very happy to have a real, live website that anyone with the link can view and they can change how they please.</p>



<p>I also stressed the importance of copyright and not using images from other websites without permission.  So we used Getty Images which include a special code which gives permission to display their images on your website.  The websites themselves were hosted on neocities.</p>
