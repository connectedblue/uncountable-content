<p>I just completed a quarterly review of my finances.  There a few components to this but the main activities are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Valuation of all assets in portfolio on that day</li>



<li>Last 12 months <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">non-discretionary spend</a> (download 12 months of bank transactions and delete the irrelevant ones)</li>



<li>Review forward <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/" data-type="post" data-id="289">assumptions about the future</a></li>



<li>Log a few benchmark values (RPI, index fund prices)</li>



<li>Check cash position </li>



<li>Define action(s) to take (if any)</li>
</ul>



<p>The bottom line was everything is fine, and the only thing of note is that my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/personal-inflation/" data-type="post" data-id="1900">personal inflation</a> is still creeping up &#8211; a trend every quarter over the last 18 months. But, in any case, no action needed.</p>



<p>This review takes me only about an hour to gather the raw data and another hour to digest the results.  It was refined over many years.  In fact my first ever investment in 1998 had a spreadsheet forecast to go with it.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve come to realise that the reason I&#8217;m financially independent is not because I&#8217;m good at investing, but rather that I&#8217;m good at planning. My overall objective is not to make as much money as possible, but instead, to be able to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-risk/" data-type="post" data-id="663">place my hands on the money I need</a> at every point until I die.</p>



<p>This might seem an impossible thing to plan for &#8211; I mean how do you start to model all your future money needs?  But it&#8217;s surprisingly easy &#8211; most people already have all the information they need to answer that question.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve released <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/modelling-your-financial-future/" data-type="post" data-id="2185">my financial planning model</a> for anyone to look at, in the hope that it inspires how you think about your own.</p>



<p>The reason why I write about money is to challenge others to think about their own financial situation more closely and whether it&#8217;s serving their needs.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a plan, then you for sure will never be wealthy.  Having a plan does not bring wealth itself, but it does give you tangible next steps that you can take to improve your future financial outcomes.</p>
