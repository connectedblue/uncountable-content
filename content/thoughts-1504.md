<p>Sometime ago, I borrowed from <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/">Tracy Durnell</a> the idea of styling external links differently . The north east arrow like this appears on all links that are not internal to my <code>uncountable.uk</code> domain.</p>



<p>I think this helps because I like to cross link a lot to my other posts, so this gives a nice visual clue between internal and external references.  This also includes links to <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a> which is on a different subdomain, but still render as internal links.</p>



<p>I made a recent tweak to this interface to include a purple &#8220;visited&#8221; colour on external links.  This is a common pattern on search engines, although I&#8217;ve not seen it so much on blogs.  But, it&#8217;s another service to the reader to give them a clue as to whether they have visited that external link before or not.</p>



<p>To see it in action, click on the link to Tracy&#8217;s site above and come back here &#8211; should now be purple (of course, if you have been to her site before, it would already have been purple). Although if you do click through, you&#8217;re unlikely to return here &#8211; Tracy&#8217;s site is an awesome read and easy to get lost in for hours.</p>



<p>When I set up this blog, one of the first posts I wrote was <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/design-thoughts/" data-type="post" data-id="46">a design statement</a> on how I wanted this website to appear to the world.  That was actually very helpful in shaping the look, but also not just adding random stuff for the sake of it.  </p>



<p>I think this change to links is in spirit of that initial statement. But I have also developed deeper thoughts for <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1156">the purpose of the main home page and rss feed</a>, so perhaps now is a good time to update that design statement.</p>



<p>If you want to see the code for the external link styling, go ahead and open the developer tools on this post and take a look!</p>
