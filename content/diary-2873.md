<p>My dad picked me up one day from school, and at the end of the road we turned left instead of right.  When I asked why we were going this way, he replied this is where our new house is.  We had moved to Pine Hill in Epsom.</p>



<p>I remember walking around the new house before we bought it and being told that the front bedroom was for me and Daniel.  I was excited because there was a radio in it on the desk.  I was disappointed to find no radio when we finally moved in.  I asked where it was and apparently the previous owners took it with them.  </p>



<p>There was a sticker of a pointing hand on the built in desk.  That was second prize and I was glad they didn&#8217;t take that as well.</p>



<p>A new kitchen was built which was navy blue plastic.  There were four tables that pulled out from the space between the drawers and the cupboard &#8211; three singles and a double.  My dad and brother had the double.  I had a single next to Katy and my mum had the other single.  </p>



<p>When the meal was over, the tables pushed back in and the chairs were stacked by the back door.  One of them had a cushion and was called the posh chair.  My mum had that because we couldn&#8217;t agree between us who deserved to sit on the posh chair to eat.</p>
