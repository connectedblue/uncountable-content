<p>Nice reading recommendation from Yordi about <a href="https://yordi.me/a-december-read-about-love-and-math/">Love and Math</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--15">
<p>The Riemann Hypothesis—while being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ysth8g/eli5_what_is_the_riemann_hypothesis_and_why_is_it/?rdt=56008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost unexplainably hard to understand</a>—is one of our mathematical mysteries. It&#8217;s so mysterious that the person who solves it will earn a million dollars. If it&#8217;s solved, the advancement of our earthly civilization will be unimaginable and might even be a threat to alien civilizations.</p>



<p>Or anyway, that&#8217;s how Matt Haig presents it in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://hardcover.app/books/the-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Humans</em></a>. When this famous mathematical question is solved by a professor, an alien race sends an envoy to Earth to prevent this solution from becoming public by killing anyone who might publish it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&#8217;s not to love about that? I&#8217;ve read the Midnight Library which was also a good multi dimensional universe type of read (and inspired my blog post about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/finite-is-quite-large/" data-type="post" data-id="396">finite video libraries</a>).</p>



<p>Best of all, it&#8217;s available on my local library app.  I&#8217;m in a queue, so I&#8217;ll get the email when the book is available for me to pick up in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Three of my favourite things rolled into one:  reading blogs over RSS, borrowing books from the library and reading novels about maths.</p>
