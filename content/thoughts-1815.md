<p>Income is a payment received from someone who has benefitted from an asset that you own.</p>



<p>The most obvious example is your time. You allocate that to a business for a set period and they give you a salary in return. Or, if you own a bond, you receive a coupon from the entity who you lent the money to. Or, if you own a property, you receive a rental payment from the tenant.</p>



<p>Dividends from a company are different.  They are a return of capital to you that you already own.  Nothing really has changed.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Apple&#8217;s share price is $227.52 and it&#8217;s market value is $3,460bn. There are 15.2bn shares outstanding. The value of cash on the balance sheet is $62bn.</p>



<p>This means that the market view of the value of Apple&#8217;s enterprise operations is $3,398bn. When you add in the cash of $62bn, you get the total market value of $3,460bn, leading to the share price of $227.52.</p>



<p>If Apple decided to pay a $1 dividend today, then the cash on the balance sheet would drop to $47bn because that $15bn of dividend no longer belongs to Apple.  The market view today of the value of Apple&#8217;s enterpise operations has not changed, so the market value of the company is now $47bn + $3,398bn which is $3,445bn, or $226.52.</p>



<p>So nothing has changed. You used to own a share worth $227, and now you have $1 of cash and a share worth $226. No income has been created. All that has happened is some of the capital you used to own through equity has been returned to you as cash.</p>



<p>Now suppose, instead of paying a dividend, Apple decided to spend the $15bn on buying back their own shares. Let&#8217;s also assume that they can make that purchase instaneously and they pay $227.52 a share. They repurchase 67,000 shares and the market value of the company is reduced to $3,445bn. However, the number of shares outstanding has reduced to 15.13bn, and so the share price remains $227.52.</p>



<p>Again, nothing has changed.  If you sold your share back to apple, you are now holding $227 in cash.  If you didn&#8217;t, you are still holding a share worth $227.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s certainly true that dividend is taxed as income.  And if you were one of those that sold in the buy back, the profit would be taxed as capital gains.</p>



<p>But from a purely investing standpoint, there is no income.  </p>



<p>When you stop work, and you wish to live off your accumulated assets, the question you should ask yourself is &#8220;how much money do I need this year?&#8221;, not &#8220;how much income can I generate this year?&#8221;.</p>



<p>If you ask the first question, you can then plan precisely how to obtain that money from your portfolio.  There is no earthly reason why the amount of money you need bears any relation to capital growth, dividends, coupons or any of the other components of total return.</p>
