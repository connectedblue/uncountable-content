<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Absolutely filthy weather all day.  We got the tail end of a cyclone that hit higher up the South Island. </p>
<p>Drove down to Haast to see the exhibits at the Visitor centre.  It was a good display &#8211; probably the best visitor centre around New Zealand.  Went on out to the coast road down to Jackson Bay but couldn&#8217;t really see anything because of the weather.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much to do in this part if it&#8217;s raining &#8211; no shops, activities or anything.  The only things to do are outdoors which is a bit of a no no today.</div>
