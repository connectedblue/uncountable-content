<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member DeltaD who has been a lifelong investor, planner and now enjoys life with financial independence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>I built a career working globally, promoting British businesses abroad and in the last 10 years of my career I worked in Digital Operations (International) for a large US Medical Insurance company.</p>



<p>Became financially independent at the age of 50. Now, my investments pay for my expenses and more. I have always been a saver, always look for true value when spending on anything and very much in favour of living below means.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>I always wanted to invest but the opportunity came when I was 29 years old. My first investment was £2,500 borrowed from my family for a deposit towards a 1 bed house that was worth £45,000. I still own that property that is now paid in full and is still rented out. </p>



<p>I started to invest in stocks and shares after the dot com crisis, around 2002. I made plenty of mistakes in the beginning and lost a lot of money. Time in the market helped to even out the initial losses.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>Cautious with occasional burst of irrational behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us about an irrational moment</h3>



<p>Went to a presentation in a fancy hotel and was so charmed by one guy’s story that I decided to invest in his property investment company. Part of the story was how he recovered from two bankruptcies.</p>



<p>Sure enough, couple of years from that presentation he went bankrupt and I lost all my investment. The saving grace was that I live by the rules and I am grateful I did not invest more than what was minimum requirement cash he was asking for. </p>



<p>I thought long and hard about how to avoid the itchy fingers and falling for trade ‘opportunity’ pressures, so I am adding what I call my lottery money (the £10/month I would spend on a lottery ticket) to trade short term in/out stocks on a platform that allows part/share transactions. </p>



<p>This allows me to test various theories whilst having fun and not losing money I can’t afford to lose.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?</h3>



<p>Bit of both. I do make use of income from property rental for daily expense whilst I re-invest most of dividend income from stocks to grow the SIPP &amp; ISA portfolios. </p>



<p>I have been financially independent for 4 years.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What was the decision process to actually declare financially independence at a young age?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I was in a ‘just one more year’ situation for few years before I actually decided to stop working. Then the perfect storm happened and that was the biggest push to act:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Covid. When the world took a break, my work increased three fold.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lost parents and close friends to Covid related medical complications.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shares in company I was working for went through the roof (medical, pharmacy in US) so I sold and together with emergency pot savings we paid all remaining mortgage.</li>
</ol>



<p>In that context, the rent income from my property increased and saving rates improved a lot from what they were before Covid. </p>



<p>So, in the middle of that storm I figured the volatility won’t last and provided I keep mentally sane, I will be ok, then figure next steps when circumstances calm down a little.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How did you replace the structure, identity and purpose that work provides after you became financially independent?</h3>



<p>My financial freedom happened in the middle of a chaotic environment with a lot of personal trauma so I was grateful that I could lose the stress that came with the work I was doing and just focus on my well-being and my family and figure out next steps. </p>



<p>I am a highly organised individual and hate chaos and volatility (in markets as in life) but I understand that I need to allow them to happen. So I have done what everybody does in the first year, or two of retirement: read many books (mostly investment related), engage and socialise more in person with family and friends, this take considerable amount of time and resources as most of them are scattered around the world, made new friends, look after house and garden. </p>



<p>It took three years to slowly add structure and purpose to my life. One of my goals for when I achieve financial independence was to spend time doing only activities I enjoy so learning about markets and various businesses is something I naturally like and I am curious about. The world of business fascinates me and is an area that impacts all of our lives and I find it amazing that, through the markets, I can be part-owner of exciting companies that change the way we are living and also help pay my bills. </p>



<p>I spend the equivalent of a part time job reading financial reports, attending investor events or engaging with investor communities and diligently tracking the performance of my portfolio and I love it. </p>



<p>I have morning coffee watching the start of Europe markets and my afternoon snack with the opening of US markets with plenty of gardening, travelling and visiting a museum or art gallery in between.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>From the beginning my focus was on income. I try to increase the income from all my investments to, at least, keep up with inflation. </p>



<p>Another goal is to live off the income generated by reinvested income, after I cash in the principal invested. I have been tracking the principal since I have started investing. </p>



<p>Finally, there is growth and as the pot grows, I allocate more to funds where smarter people than myself can manage my money going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>We keep a very close eye on spend needs and household budget whilst making sure the income from various sources covers those needs and more. As a household, we keep an easy access pot for emergencies or treats.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do you plan to keep your rented property for long term income, or sell it at some point?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We have a small portfolio of rented properties that are under a ltd company. The rental income covers the maintenance and running costs and provides income. </p>



<p>We plan to, eventually, let children become shareholders in the company and continue to grow the portfolio for the long term (after we are gone). There is the option to sell if needed but this will be considered if our usual income and emergency fund won’t be able to cover the need.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you the main financial planner in your household?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>Me and my husband are equal partners in managing our household finances, but investing in stocks and shares is solely my area. We are working on making it ‘simple’ if one of us won’t be able to carry on but the simplification process is not smooth.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp;</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>thetimes.com</li>



<li>ii.co.uk</li>



<li>theaic.co.uk</li>



<li>seekingalpha.com</li>



<li>Bloomberg tv</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>Anything related to investor behaviour. How people reach the decision to buy or sell into a position. What rules and boundaries people use when managing their portfolios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graphs, statistics on market and investor behaviour. There are some great visuals out there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recommendations on investment books, films ..&nbsp;</p>
