<p>A large amount of human endeavour is undertaken in the form of events. An event is simply an activity with a defined location, start and end time.</p>



<p>There are broadly three ways to participate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Spectating</strong>.  You witness the event, but the outcome would have been the same if you hadn&#8217;t been there.</li>



<li><strong>Contributing</strong>.  Your presence influences the outcome of the event.</li>



<li><strong>Organising</strong>.  You undertook tasks before the event, without which it couldn&#8217;t have taken place.</li>
</ul>



<p>There is overlap between these of course.  Spectators of football often claim they are &#8220;the twelth man&#8221; by contributing encouragement.  As a spectator, you can also contribute in small ways &#8211; for example if you are attending a talk on a topic, you can ask a question at the end.</p>



<p>I believe though that the most satisfaction comes from attending events where you make significant contribitions, or indeed, organise them.  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve focussed on since stopping work.  </p>



<p>My calendar usually has around 25-30 events per month, probably in the proportion 5% spectating/75% contributing/20% organising.  I document most, but by no means all, in my <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">online diary</a>. </p>



<p>You sometimes hear the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;d get bored in retirement&#8221;, which I think people use to signal that they have a fulfilling work life.  But it could just as easily be a cover for people unable or unwilling to contemplate another way of living life.</p>



<p>If you truly are a person who thrives on &#8220;being busy&#8221;, then you&#8217;ll find literally hundreds of events each week in your local area that you can contribute to if you no longer work.  At least one of those will align with something you are passionate about.</p>



<p>Sometimes you want a particular kind of event, but none exists in your area, so you become the organiser.  This can be very rewarding &#8211; I currently organise three different events (and am extricating myself from a fourth).  The downside to organising is that it can become a burden.  You quickly discover that no-one really likes organising, and quite often you&#8217;ll be left alone to do the tasks.</p>



<p>Time is the only important asset we have really, and it&#8217;s dwindling before our very eyes.  When you no longer work, you can <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocate time</a> however you choose, and having a diary full of events is an excellent way to maximise return on available time.</p>
