<p>Robin is wondering whether the <a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/So-Many-Websites/">decline of search</a> might actually lead to a better and smaller web:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--3">
<p>But perhaps the death of search is&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;for the future of the web. Perhaps websites can be free of dumb rankings and junky ads that are designed to make fractions of a penny at a time. Perhaps the web needs to be released from the burden of this business model. Perhaps mass readership isn’t possible for the vast majority of websites and was never really sustainable in the first place.</p>

<p>The analogy with books is exactly relevant.  There are so, so many books and most don&#8217;t have mass readership.  And books are thriving more than ever in the digital age.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/not-on-google/" data-type="post" data-id="515">don&#8217;t allow my personal websites</a> to be indexed by search engines.  I did at first, and used to spend time in the google search console trying to figure out why they refused to index one third of the posts. </p>



<p>In the end, I thought to myself &#8220;well, if you&#8217;re not going to index them all, then you&#8217;re not going to index any&#8221; and denied access to all in my robots.txt.</p>



<p>Now I actively relish being stumbled upon rather than discovered.  I also have a steady trickle of lovely <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guest-book/" data-type="post" data-id="187">comments in my guest book</a>, which gives me a much bigger dopamine hit than any SEO traffic dashboard ever could.</p>



<p>My little corner of the web is doing just fine without search.</p>
