<p>I made a surprising detour this week by returning to LinkedIn after two years.  I was inspired after writing about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">my 200 year writing plan</a> and also by <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/importing-previous-thoughts/" data-type="post" data-id="608">recovering the half dozen posts</a> from my very first blog.</p>



<p>I wrote an awful lot of posts on LinkedIn between 2018 and 2022. Although I didn&#8217;t perceive it as such, I was actually blogging, but within the confines of that platform. So that writing represents a huge chunk of my output and needs to be stored here rather than get lost forever in their scroll.</p>



<p>So I unfroze my account and set to work finding how to download the post archive.  While there, of course I couldn&#8217;t resist looking a few people up and making a couple of posts.  There are a few people on there who I enjoyed much banter with over the years and it was lovely to slide into comment threads and connect with them again.</p>



<p>Of course, I also dropped links to this blog and <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a>, and those posts generated a nice collection of comments from people I know.  According to the dashboard, my posts generated 11,000 views in two days &#8211; no doubt boosted by an algorithm wishing to inject as much dopamine as possible to a returning member.</p>



<p>But my overwhelming sense was boredom.  Scrolling and commenting on LinkedIn is terribly dull.  I put out a poll asking if people would still come on LinkedIn if they no longer worked, and half said no.</p>



<p>So half the people are on there only to improve their work outcomes. </p>



<p>It shows. Work is an important component of life, but sharing the experience with others is wretched.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m unable to invest the time needed to stay on LinkedIn permanently.  Here&#8217;s my plan of action:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Get the old posts and figure out the best way to import them here</li>



<li>Drop in a daily post with a link back to an article I&#8217;ve written on my own blogs.  Practising <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> in other words.</li>



<li>Evangelise RSS and having your own blog to give people on there an alternative option for digital living.</li>



<li>Banter with a few people in the comment section of other people&#8217;s post.</li>



<li>Stay on long enough to launch the Artocalypse site in a few weeks.</li>
</ul>



<p>Then, once the dopamine has worn off, I&#8217;ll freeze the account again and return to my IndieWeb existence.</p>



<p>I do rather like the idea of being a digital Brigadoon though. Every so often, I will unfreeze the account again and dance for a week before returning back here.</p>
