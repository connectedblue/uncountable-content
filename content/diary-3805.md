<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Raining when we got up &#8211; first time we&#8217;ve seen that, but we&#8217;re traveling today, so it doesn&#8217;t really matter.  Headed off at 10am down to Taupo &#8211; a town on the edge of a huge lake.  Had some lunch in a cafe there, but there&#8217;s not much to write home aout in taupo.</p>
<p>After lunch we took the road to Napier &#8211; absolutely fantastic drive through mountains and valleys.  The satnav took us the back route to best paddock cottage which was an interesting diversion.  The cottage is fantastic &#8211; tucked away at the end of a vineyard.  All the facilities including a BBQ which will be handy.</p>
<p>Despite the rain this morning in Tuaranga, it was 26C here in Hawkes Bay.  Found a supermarket and stocked up for this part of the trip.    </div>
