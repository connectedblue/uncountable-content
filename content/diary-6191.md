<p>Headed up to Stinchcombe in the morning to support Kathy who was hosting a  Wildflower Society meeting on the Hill today.</p>



<p>We started in the golf clubhouse with some coffee and had a presentation from Kathy about the grassland restoration work that&#8217;s been undertaken and the importance of collecting survey data to track how well grazing management works in the future.</p>



<p>We split into two groups and I led one across the course and along the ridge towards the SSSI.  However, this was a group of botanists and progress was extremely slow.  We did spot a few &#8220;treasured&#8221; species &#8211; ones that should be common on the grassland, but are currently shaded out by the dominant tor grass.  In particular, there was a big clump of Dyer&#8217;s saw-wort in an unexpected place.</p>



<p>I left everyone at lunch on the side of the hill, so I could get back down for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  The monday club is particularly advanced at the moment, and I witnessed a few make significant progress with their gaming projects during the session.</p>
