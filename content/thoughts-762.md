<p>I&#8217;ve been asked recently for my thoughts about particular topics (usually <a href="/thoughts-on/money/">money related</a>).  </p>



<p>Rather than reply in messaging or email, it&#8217;s usually more efficient for me to write a blog post instead.  If that one person has a question about it, then usually someone else will.</p>



<p>So, if you follow my blog and want to hear my thoughts about something, please drop me an email on <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll do my best to compose the best post I can.  </p>



<p>In general, I only write thoughts on things that I have experienced directly, and even then, will only write about my personal journey with that topic.  I don&#8217;t do research or think critically on this blog.  Information is provided as-is.</p>



<p>So, if I don&#8217;t have anything to write about your request, I&#8217;ll let you know!</p>
