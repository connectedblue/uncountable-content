<p>We all have different amounts of money, but each week, every person has exactly the same amount of time at their disposal (except, of course, those who sadly depart).</p>



<p>None of us know how much time we have left, but whatever the amount, it&#8217;s certainly less than was available a year ago.  So the ability to allocate all your time exactly how you choose is a worthwhile goal for this most precious of assets.</p>



<p>For most people, <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/" data-type="post" data-id="529">planning to reach financial independence</a> is the best way to achieve that goal. I started taking this seriously from age 30, but honestly didn&#8217;t really know exactly what I&#8217;d be doing with all this new time. Only once stopping work was I able to explore various ways to do this. I document my activities in <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my online diary</a>.</p>



<p>Having freedom to allocate time as you want doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you don&#8217;t work. I do work. I just don&#8217;t get paid, and it&#8217;s mostly very different from work I used to get paid to do.</p>



<p>Sometimes people offer to pay me for work, but my current policy is to decline.  That gives me maximum flexibility to pick and choose what work I do.  In other words, I&#8217;m seeking all <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">the benefits of work</a> except money.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t allocate all my time to work.  Sometimes I walk, hold community events, stare at the wall, write computer programs, visit friends and family and other activities that I want to indulge in.</p>



<p>My most important tool these days is my calendar, since that is the primary way I have to allocate forthcoming time.  Most weeks are pretty full, but odd days exist when I choose what to do on the spur of the moment.  </p>



<p>And then my diary helps me review and remember how I allocated time gone by.</p>
