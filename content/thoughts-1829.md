<p>The average mammal species is around for a million years until it becomes extinct.  So far, we are 200,000 years in, and assuming there is nothing particularly special about homo sapiens, we have around 800,000 years left.</p>



<p>Unless we extinct ourselves sooner, of course. In which case, we have essentially zero years left in the grand scheme of geological time. Even if we manage to hold on for another 30,000 years before destroying ourselves, that&#8217;s really just zero compared with 800,000 years.</p>



<p>Assuming we do somehow learn to live with ourselves and our environment, it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine what the existence of humans in 800,000 years will be like. The exponential growth of human experience since the industrial revolution already makes today&#8217;s world unrecognisable to a 17th century time traveller.</p>



<p>When those far distant humans look back on our lifestyle today, we will be seen as an ancient civilisation &#8211; even more primitive than we view stone age humans.  </p>



<p>&#8220;How proud they were of their aeroplanes, their wifi and their fridges&#8221; the future human teacher might say to their charges.</p>



<p>If we do make it that far, there&#8217;s a good chance we will have colonised other planets, either in our solar system or beyond. Our machines cocooning us in those harsh environments.</p>



<p>As they orbit distant stars, those humans will look back in wonder at their ancestors who somehow had the foresight to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/teaching-sand-to-add/" data-type="post" data-id="1439">teach sand to add up</a>.</p>
