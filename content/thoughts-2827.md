<p>I&#8217;m writing this on 31 December 2025, the day before the new Traitors series begins with a major new game play twist.  This has been teased by Claudia Winkleman wearing a red cloak, but no details have been revealed.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure there is a mountain of speculation on social media, but I don&#8217;t participate in that.  So instead, I&#8217;m posting my thoughts here as to what it could be.  We can see after the first show how wildly wrong or right I was.</p>



<p>I think the red cloak will be given to a Faithful at the start of the game which will protect them from murder and also give them additional information about the status of other players in the game. The identity of the red cloak is known to the Traitors, but not to the rest of the Faithful.</p>



<p>All players know there is a red cloak.  If they happen to be banished at the round table, they are not allowed to reveal they were the red cloak.</p>



<p>The additional information could be they are told the name of one, or more Traitors.  Or it could be that they are able to ask for the status of say three other players.</p>



<p>Depending on the exact nature of the information provided to the red cloak, it will make for some interesting alliances and game play.  For example, if the red cloak knows who all the traitors are, that will make for some very interesting side conversations.  </p>



<p>Also, every time a Faithful was banished, there would be immediate speculation about whether they had the red cloak and their game play would be picked over more closely in the aftermath.</p>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be immediately obvious how to play this super power if you were awarded the red cloak.  Do you keep it a secret and then if the heat falls on you at the round table, reveal your status and the status of the players you know about.</p>



<p>Also, if you are a Faithful, but don&#8217;t have the red cloak, do you claim to have it to try and give yourself an edge in alliances?</p>



<p>All will be revealed very shortly, and I will be glued to the series.</p>
