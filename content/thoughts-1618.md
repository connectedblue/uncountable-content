<p>you weren&#8217;t in when i knocked, so i left the flowers on the windscreen of a parked car on the way home.  but the handle snapped on the garden fork the first time you used it. at midnight we cycled down to the lake to float in the warm water. i didn&#8217;t mean to crush your work like that. the ringing phone on the empty desk would change the next ten years. you convinced me that day over a coffee in the service station.  i know I shouldn&#8217;t have spoken that way.  the silence at midnight felt like neither the end nor the beginning.  </p>
