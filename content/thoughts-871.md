<p>Having just read <a href="https://www.iaindale.com/articles/my-10-predictions-for-the-general-election">Iain Dale&#8217;s blog post on his predictions</a>, I thought it would be fun to do the same and compare afterwards. I don&#8217;t put dates on blog posts, so for the record, it&#8217;s 30 June 2024, a few days before the election on 4 July.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll follow the same format as Iain and put my marker down for those 10 topics.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Labour majority will be between 110 and 150.</li>



<li>Conservatives will get less than 100 seats.</li>



<li>Lib Dems will get 60-80 seats.</li>



<li>Greens will win 3.</li>



<li>SNP will get 20 to 30 seats.</li>



<li>Nigel Farage will win Clacton.</li>



<li>Turnout will be 67-69%.</li>



<li>Rishi Sunak will resign on Friday, having lost his seat.</li>



<li>Biggest post election talking point will be the imbalance of FPTP, with the focus being liberals on a lower vote share than Reform but with 10x the seats.</li>



<li>Keir Starmer will create two new departments, one for Energy and Environment and the other for Business Growth.</li>
</ul>



<p>What are your predictions?  </p>



<p>If you want to join in the fun, you&#8217;ve got a few days left to lock them in on your blog.  Send me the link on <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll add to a list below.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll do a post election blog post on the predictions and announce who is the next John Curtice!</p>
