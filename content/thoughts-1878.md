<p>The bulk of my portfolio is invested in <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-i-invest-in-stocks/" data-type="post" data-id="1444">equity index funds</a>, which are split between FTSE100 and S&amp;P500.</p>



<p>I am very much a passive investor, seeking only the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/" data-type="post" data-id="456">guaranteed market return</a> over every time period.  But you still need to have a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/choosing-a-passive-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="838">passive investing strategy</a> and choose how much to invest in different markets.</p>



<p>My last major portfolio re-allocation was in 2022, when I moved 40% into the S&amp;P500 and the remaining 60% is FTSE100.  These percentage allocations were more or less plucked out the air, but the underlying thesis was that London represents a slower growing, but more reliable set of utility type companies (banks, food, construction etc), whereas America represents the home of capital where growing industries seek to raise capital.</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m in draw down, I use a two bucket strategy &#8211; <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">four years of non-discretionary spend</a> in cash (bucket one) and the remainder in equities (bucket two).  The allocation between US and UK is a kind of &#8220;bucket within  a bucket&#8221; in that I intend to withdraw from the UK index funds to top up bucket one, leaving the US side to grow more over the longer term.</p>



<p>This means that over time, the initial 60:40 split will drift towards 50:50 and beyond over the next decade or so.  I review everything once a quarter, but don&#8217;t intend to re-balance the portfolio unless any substantial changes in macro conditions occur.</p>
