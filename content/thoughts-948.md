<p>Communication between people is, in essence, the sending and receiving of signals to satisfy a human desire.</p>



<p>The richness of signal is entirely dependent on the medium of communication.  An asynchronous exchange of letters has a very different style to a telephone conversation or text.  The medium may also impact the content of the signal &#8211; there are things you might say over the phone that you would not over text (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>Social media created a variety of bilateral signals that amplify these effects.  If I read your post in my feed, an anonymous signal is sent to add one to your view count.  If I press the like button, I&#8217;m sending you a stronger signal that identifies me to you.   If I comment, then we have a deeper exchange of signals.</p>



<p>In turn, this can impact the style of content you send over the medium.   If you want views, likes and comments, you will write in a different way than if you had no feedback from the readers.</p>



<p>I try to avoid this by using two different mediums to receive and send signals to the public internet.  </p>



<p>I send signals primarily by writing posts on my blogs.  I have no idea who reads what (although I have a rough idea of daily overall visitor numbers from rudimentary traffic stats on my host). </p>



<p>Conversely, I receive signals from 600+ sources via my RSS reader.  None of those authors know either that I&#8217;m subscribed, or whether I read a particular piece of content.  There is no acknowledgement signal from my reader back to the site.</p>



<p>Yet, despite this deliberate separation of concerns, I feel very much part of a networked community.  I stumble upon posts that contain links to posts I have made in the past.  And I also make reply posts to topics others have raised.  And I&#8217;m gaining inspiration from every interaction I have, whether in public or private.</p>



<p>Social media is definitely not the only way to exchange meaningful messages &#8211; the internet itself is built on reliably connecting signals between senders and recipients.  </p>



<p>Explore those other ways and you may just find a better way of digital life.</p>
