<p>Decided this morning to go for a walk when I got up at 6am.  I haven&#8217;t done this in a long time and forgot how pleasant it is to be in beech woods at this time of day, at this time of year.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been developing an app to help <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> with the 2024 survey season.  I met up with Anna and Lorna at a nearby farm to give it a field test before we unleash it on the wider survey team tomorrow.</p>



<p>The site was stunning &#8211; although it&#8217;s close to my house, I hadn&#8217;t walked this valley before.  A top grade, species rich grassland in a very steep valley.  Will, the owner, was very interesting and we had a long chat about how he&#8217;s managing the land.</p>



<p>We did the first couple of quadrats together and made a lot of notes of small tweaks to improve the collection flow in the field.  I left them at 1pm, because I had code club, but got accused of being a lightweight because it also happened to start raining then.</p>



<p>Held the usual session of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> in the afternoon, which went well.  The regulars continued to work on their website and some others practised scratch and python.</p>



<p>I returned to the PC later that evening and found 30 quadrats uploaded by Lorna and Anna.  This all looked in good order, so I made the changes we agreed to the app, ready for the volunteer team tomorrow.</p>
