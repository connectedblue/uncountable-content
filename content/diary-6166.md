<p>It was predicted to be a warm day, so I set out early to do the raft monitoring for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  I hadn&#8217;t seen much of anything in the last few weeks, but today there was a probable water vole latrine on one of the rafts.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t seen water vole signs here for quite some time.  The banks are covered in thick reeds, ideal habitat for them.  Sadly there were no prints on the cartridge, but is was quite dry in the heat so not picking up too much.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, it was the first session of the week for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  Harry returned from university to help out again, so it was nice to see him.  This cohort are doing some amazing things with games, web pages and AI.  There&#8217;s really nothing that phases them about getting the tech to do exactly what they want.</p>
