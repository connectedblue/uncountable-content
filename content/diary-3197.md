<p>I had a few bitty tasks today for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  At 10am I had a catch up call with Pete about how we proceed with the paper based backup plan on the tree survey.  I then went out to do the regular raft survey.</p>



<p>It was a very drizzly day and the trees in the distance looked distinctly autumnal.  There were also deep cracks in the mud paths which is a far cry from the water logged fields of a couple of weeks back.  Nothing major to report from the rafts, although it&#8217;s encouraging that we keep seeing otter speint.</p>



<p>I then wandered over to Stroud to give my paperwork in for the DBS checks for the canal project.  This will be a useful exercise to complete as I can then use it for other organisations like the library.  It&#8217;ll take a few weeks no doubt, but there&#8217;s no rush.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I went to the library for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  Luckily the PCs were back to full operation after the shenanigans of last week.  We had two new children  this week, and they had to share a PC.  So a total of nine.  The remaining sessions this term are already booked out.</p>
