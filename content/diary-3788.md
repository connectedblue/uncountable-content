<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Up early again to head to Queenstown for 7.30am.  A bus picked us up from the visitor centre and took us to Glenorchy.</p>
<p>We had to get changed into wetsuits, fleeces, rain overtop and life jacket.  We went into a jet boat for a one hour trip up the Dart river.  Along the way he spun the boat in 360 turns.  Sheila was sitting at the end of a row and got the most wet.  After we finished the jet boating, we got into 2 person inflatable canoes and canoed downstream.</p>
<p>It was quite difficult to steer and canoe at the same time so we got stuck a lot and span around quite a bit. Luckily the river wasn&#8217;t all that deep in a lot of places so we could hop out and push.  About halfway down the river we stopped off for some lunch.  The company laid on drinks and a sandwich buffet as well as some drinks.</p>
<p>We got back to Glenorchy at around 4pm to pick up our photos and get the bus back to queentown.  We were pretty exhausted after having canoed for around 2 hours.  Got back to the cottage but just watched TV at night.</div>
