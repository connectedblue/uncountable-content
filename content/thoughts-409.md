<p>Summer 2024 is in full swing, with seed harvesting, balsam pulling and monitoring and surveying.  I&#8217;m planning my autumn and winter schedule now and there&#8217;s quite a few projects lined up:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Summer code clubs in the library where the theme is building a sports website</li>



<li>Lead a course on wordpress for some 16-24 year olds who are not in employment, education or training.</li>



<li>Complete the October Walking festival website and open up for bookings</li>



<li>Organise autumn and winter green drinks sessions</li>



<li>Small mammal river monitoring</li>



<li>Sowing seed to restore meadows</li>



<li>Riverfly monitoring on two established sites</li>



<li>Autumn term coding club after school in the library</li>



<li>Environmental land management plan for the local town</li>



<li>Annual walking festival in October</li>



<li>Weekly land management at Wild Acres</li>



<li>Winter habitat management with Glorious Grasslands</li>



<li>Developing expo feature for the Artocalypse</li>



<li>Reading challenge on the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</li>
</ul>



<p>Quite a list when you write it down.  There&#8217;s plenty of other admin type activities as well, so my calendar will be pretty full.</p>



<p>You can follow along in <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a> to see how I actually get on with this list</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)">Then</h2>



<p>Now is now.</p>



<p>Soon now will be then.</p>
