<p>This is going to be a different post to the usual diary entry, when I&#8217;ll look back at the year as a whole and record some thoughts.</p>



<p>The first point of reference is that I began to write this diary this year, so most of the key events are recorded in detail.  But I intend to go back and write a single post for each of the previous 54 years, with my (incomplete) recollection of that year.  That will take some time to do, but is the best way I can think of to have a whole life diary when I didn&#8217;t keep entries for most of it.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t remember exactly which was my first entry &#8211; it was sometime in April.  I then back filled the dates back to the beginning of the year.  This really brought home why I wanted to keep the diary in the first place &#8211; even just a few months after an activity, it was hard to recall the details of what happened, let alone the small details which made each one special.  </p>



<p>My main motivation is because I visit so many places, meet so many people and learn so many things that it&#8217;s really hard to keep track of.  I also want to link and promote the various organisations I&#8217;m involved with.  I&#8217;m not active on social media so having my own digital space to record whatever I want is important.</p>



<p>I also have a broader goal which I haven&#8217;t yet pursued:  I want my writing to be accessible in 200 years time.  </p>



<p>I have some ideas how I might do this, but now that 2023 has passed, I can consider more carefully how to create an archive that will sustain for many centuries.  My ideas so far are to generate a book with an ISBN number deposited with the British Library, create a public domain github repository, make a zip file and upload to as many different archive platforms as I can find.</p>



<p>So, if you are reading this in the future, greetings from 2023!  Your world is very different to mine, and I&#8217;m gutted not to experience it.  But I can at least tell you a bit about mine, if you wish to know.</p>



<p>I became a lot more involved with Stroud Valley&#8217;s Project this year, doing tree planting in the first three months of the year and the canal work party over the rest of the year.</p>



<p>I also started two brand new community projects.  The first is Code Club &#8211; an after school club in the library to inspire 8-11yo to learn to program computers.  I heard they were looking for volunteers, otherwise the club would have to close.  This aligns directly with one of my passions, so I jumped at the chance to have a go.  Since March I have run many clubs, and started a new python club alongside scratch.  It&#8217;s really amazing to watch the children develop every week as they gain more curiosity and creativity.</p>



<p>The second project was a monthly gathering called Dursley Green Drinks at Kingshill House.  This came out from a work party I did in February at Stinchcombe Hill and met Jo.  It turned out we knew similar people and had similar interests, so she suggested we start a regular meeting for like-minded people.  We&#8217;ve had 6 or 7 sessions and around 20-25 attend each one, so pretty pleased with the outcome.  More importantly, the existence of this platform has enabled many people to make connections across the community that they wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise. </p>
