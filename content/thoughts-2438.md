<p>Just completed another housekeeping on the 800+ feeds in my FreshRSS instance.  There were about 30 links reporting errors.  Some had disappeared completely, some just needing removing and re-adding and others just got removed if I couldn&#8217;t get them to work.</p>



<p>Feels good now to have a clean set of feeds again</p>
