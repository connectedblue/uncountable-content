<p>I made contact a few weeks ago with the STEM outreach team at <a href="https://www.renishaw.com">Renishaw</a> to see whether they could offer some activities for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> trip to their site.  This morning I went with Fran, the library manager to meet them and look around their facility.</p>



<p>They have a pretty impressive reception with all their products on display, a bit like a museum.  This included a Wallace and Gromit dog, branded and customised with Renishaw branding.  This alone would be a great place to inspire the children.</p>



<p>I met with Lucy who runs the activities in a purpose built STEM lab.  There&#8217;s a lot they can offer within a two hour session, so I chose one with coding micro-bits to control cars around a track.  The tasks are specifically designed to make children think about how the motor control on each wheel can be coded to navigate the obstacles.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll do a trip in the summer half term.  A few logistic issues to sort out because I won&#8217;t be able to fund a coach, but otherwise is a day to look forward to.</p>
