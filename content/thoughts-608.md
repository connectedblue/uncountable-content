<p>My first blog was created in 2012, and unfortunately lasted only six articles.  It still exists on the free wordpress.com tier, so I took the opportunity this morning to <a href="/topic/first-blog/">import them into this blog</a> so I can manage everything in one place going forward.</p>



<p>I wish I had kept it going from the start.  I was interested to see that I wrote a post on my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/sixty-year-plan/" data-type="post" data-id="134">sixty year strategy</a>, which I have also recently <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-60-year-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="445">written about here</a>.</p>



<p>It was called Just My Thoughts Aloud, so a very similar idea to this blog.  I did have the .com domain at one point, but let it lapse.  The wordpress version can still be <a href="https://justmythoughtsaloud.wordpress.com/">viewed here</a>.</p>
