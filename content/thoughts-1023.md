<p>I ran an experiment last week on this blog. It was a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/july-2024-principles-of-investing-week/" data-type="post" data-id="965">series of posts on the principles of investing</a> which started with some motivation on Monday and added new ideas each weekday.</p>



<p>I advertised this series the week before on RSS by including a small snippet at the end of posts a few days beforehand.  Each post was published at 6am and no other post appeared until the next day, giving everyone who wanted a chance to catch up.</p>



<p>I have written quite a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/">few posts about money</a> on the blog, but the order they came out in was completely random.  They are based on my own financial journey, but would make little sense to anyone wanting to understand more about how and why I took certain decisions.</p>



<p>So I decided to re-publish a few of them in a more logical order.  Some readers may have read them previously, and for other readers it would be completely new.  Either way, I hope that this series provided more value to everyone over the week.</p>



<p>I was a bit hesitant to do this at first.  I thought I might break a fundamental law of blogging if I re-published previous content.  Perhaps the few RSS subscribers I do have would remove me from their readers?</p>



<p>In the end, I deployed the first rule of IndieWeb &#8211; you can do as you please on your own site.  But the whole exercise got me thinking more deeply about my readers and as a result, I&#8217;ve changed my approach to publishing on my site.</p>



<p>At first, I thought it would be easy &#8211; just change the publish date on the relevant articles and schedule to the day I wanted it to appear in the week. But then I realised those posts would no longer be live, and they are heavily cross referenced in other posts on the site.</p>



<p>So I came up with <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/disabling-internal-links/" data-type="post" data-id="994">a piece of CSS</a> that would disable the internal links to those five article temporarily on the site.  And each day I re-enabled the links for the post that was published.</p>



<p>This whole exercise was really the first time I had to consider the reader experience properly.  It dawned on me that, in the past, I had been bombarding my RSS subscribers with a rather random experience.  Sometimes four posts a day, sometimes one and sometimes none for several days.  I just wrote whatever happened to be in my head and published immediately.</p>



<p>From now on, I will employ content scheduling in a much more intentional manner.  I will do one post per day at 6am UK time.  And sometimes I might do an additional post at 6pm.  </p>



<p>I may also re-schedule previous content if I feel it is might add some value to the current readers.  </p>



<p>I still have a section of the site where I can publish random thoughts though.  There is a section called <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/">Quick Thoughts</a> and anything I place there will not appear in the main RSS feed or on the homepage.  So unless a reader specifically subscribes to, or visits that page they won&#8217;t be disturbed by my random musings.</p>
