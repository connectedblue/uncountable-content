<p>It was a day for catching up on admin.  A referral to the physio to look at my arm; a call to the bank about the ongoing saga of my access to the <a href="https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Welcomes Walkers</a> online account; baking the bread; writing minutes of the steering group meeting and planning the presentation for the <a href="https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk/">Stroud Wildlife Survey Group</a> AGM.</p>



<p>But mostly on days like this I prefer to get lost in technology rabbit holes.  Today was all about putting automations into my server so I can do things like scheduled backups.  There&#8217;ll be a separate collection of articles about my server at some point.  But I certainly spend longer configuring it than I do creating content.</p>



<p>Afternoon tea was scones, clotted cream and strawberry.  By then the rain had stopped and the late evening sun brightened up the day.</p>
