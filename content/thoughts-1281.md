<p><em>This post is part of an <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/princeton-companion-to-mathematics/">ongoing reading project</a> where I am working through the Princeton Companion to Mathematics</em></p>
<p>I had to grit my teeth through this first article of the influences section.  Chemistry is not a subject I have innate curiosity for, and consequently I have very little background knowledge, beyond my O level taken in 1985.</p>



<p>But unsurprisingly, the structure of compounds, crystals and bigger structures have a lot of group theory, differential geometry and algebra underpinning.  It seems a lot of classification work with mathematical objects produces results which concur with observations in nature.  Yet another example of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been a distinct shift in the last few decades from viewing compounds as crystals (and quasi crystals) towards surfaces and textures which can be modelled by complex analysis.  </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a specific type of surface called a Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) which appears in a huge number of chemical structures.  These can be analysed using tools developed by Weierstrass in the 1860s.  Again, an example of pure mathematics developed for it&#8217;s own sake which can find application centuries later.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t feel any more enthused about chemistry after completing this article, but feel like I have a few more examples I can throw around in conversation.</p>
