<p>Imagine we were sat in a tavern one hundred years ago, and I told you that in the future, we would teach sand how to add up and it would change the world.</p>



<p>You would certainly have grounds for a healthy dose of scepticism.  Yet here we are.  I&#8217;m typing this post into sand, it&#8217;s transported across the world using sand and you are reading it on sand.</p>



<p>The supply chain for semi conductors is truly global. The starting point is sand. One of the most abundant elements on earth. However, you can&#8217;t just go to Weston-super-Mare with your bucket and spade and start digging.</p>



<p>You need high grade pure silicone which exists mostly in deposits in Germany and the Appalachian mountains in the US. They are shipped to Australia to be compressed into ingot bars. These ingots are sent to Japan for slicing into impossibly thin wafers. The wafers are then sent to Taiwan and South Korea to be etched with nanometre logic circuits on sand molecules. Fabricated silicon is then sent to Malaysia for packaging into the plastic casing you recognise as a chip. Finally they are shipped off to China for assembling into the final products that we buy.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a monumental triumph of human ingenuity.  Yet, one hundred years ago, literally no-one was sitting there, scratching their head and wondering how to teach sand how to add up.</p>



<p>Somehow, amid all the war, famine, terror and violence of the last century, the human race still managed to squeeze out enough additional thoughts and activities to enable you to sit in the comfort of your own home and watch a dancing bear on a piece of glass.</p>



<p>How did all that even happen?</p>
