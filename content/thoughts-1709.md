<p>Like it or not, most of us dedicate a fair chunk of time to the acquisition of money, which we then use to support our lifestyle. There&#8217;s also a strong belief that if we acquire more money, we can have a better lifestyle.</p>



<p>A natural consequence is we perceive some people have more money than us, and some have less.  This perception is entirely driven by observation &#8211; we rarely, if ever, have access to the financial records of others.  </p>



<p>These observations might be their house, car, clothes, holidays, spending habits and so on.   Or we might observe their job and conclude something about their income.  A car mechanic might assume that they have less money than a lawyer.</p>



<p>After concluding that someone has more money than us, we assign them the label &#8220;rich&#8221;. There is a relative spectrum of richness &#8211; you will never be able to earn enough to be as rich as Jeff Bezos, but you probably could be as rich as your mate.</p>



<p>Being rich on the back of observations of earned income and spending is a precarious, transient position.  Would you still be as rich if your earnings halved?  Are you still rich if your spending is greater than your income and the difference fueled by debt?</p>



<p>Is a lawyer who takes home £60,000 and spends £55,000 richer than a car mechanic who takes home £30,000 and spends £20,000?</p>



<p>Over the long term, a more resilient position is to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-accumulate-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="676">build wealth</a> and increase your net worth.  The principal reason for doing so is that your investment assets can then <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/saving-versus-investing/" data-type="post" data-id="335">generate cash flow</a> to support your lifestyle, rather than needing to exchange your labour for money.</p>



<p>As a very broad rule of thumb, someone in their late 50s in the UK might need a net worth of 20 times their annual lifestyle spend to be <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/" data-type="post" data-id="529">financially independent</a>.</p>



<p>So, using the hypothetical examples above, the lawyer would need around £1.1m, while the mechanic would need £400k.   Furthermore, the lawyer is going to find it impossible to get there with only £5,000 to invest every year, whereas the mechanic should get there after 25-30 years or so.</p>



<p>In fact the lawyer would struggle to accumulate even the mechanic&#8217;s lifestyle after 30 years.</p>



<p>The important takeaway from all this is not the numbers, but the principle of wealth building.  It&#8217;s rarely about displays of income or spending levels.  Instead, you can get there with <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="228">a few consistent behaviours</a> over a long period.</p>



<p>A get rich slow scheme.</p>
