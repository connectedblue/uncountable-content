<p>I&#8217;m helping with the Lego Robot Challenge club at <a href="https://rednockschool.org.uk/">Rednock School</a>. It&#8217;s an after school club for years 8 and 9 where they have to complete a number of robot challenges before a judging panel in Bristol next February.</p>



<p>Today was the second club &#8211; we got started a couple of weeks before half term.  The first part of the exercise is to construct lego obstacles which the robot will detect and negotiate as part of the challenge.  </p>



<p>They are quite technically challenging to assemble &#8211; they have moving parts with things like a winch pulling a bucket on a crane.  Today they worked in 4 teams to complete more new models.  </p>



<p>They all work very well together and did a lot of problem solving.  Quite often it seems as if you have built the structure but a peg is in the wrong place and jams everything.  So you have to disassemble, trouble shoot and put it back together.  But by the end of the hour we had three new models for the map.</p>



<p>Next week we&#8217;ll start assembling the robot and doing basic coding like getting it to move across the map and detect the obstacles.</p>
