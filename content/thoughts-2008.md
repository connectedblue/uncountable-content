<p>The world&#8217;s largest media owner, Mark Zuckerberg, has just declared that fact checking is something that will not be attempted by the platform going forward.</p>



<p>I feel this is a major inflection point in the journey toward our lives to be controlled by megalithic global platforms. There is a clear linkage between the media owners, far right politicians and election campaign funding. Yes sure, Murdoch controlled the media and political narrative in the past, but he will look like a paper boy in comparison with the landscape by 2030.</p>



<p>Fact checking is not in and of itself a necessity.  I don&#8217;t fact check every statement I make on this blog.  I write from my own experience and as accurately as I can.  If someone pointed out a factual error in one of my previous posts, I will correct at that point.</p>



<p>But my blog is distributed only to those who wish to see it &#8211; largely RSS subscribers and people who click through from the limited community spaces where I drop links.  If people tire of my posts, they can either unsubscribe or cease clicking.  I am not, I don&#8217;t believe, causing harm by distributing content through my website.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an entirely different matter for the media platforms though.  In order to sell advertising, they promote engagement inducing content into the feeds of all their readers using a private distribution algorithm.  So to give up on content moderation altogether, they are saying to their users &#8220;if you suffer harm by reading this thing we decided to show you, then it&#8217;s your fault, not ours&#8221;.</p>



<p>None of this is particularly new, or earth shattering.  We&#8217;ve known the incentives and motivations of centi-billionaire media owners for some time.  It&#8217;s just now they&#8217;ve openly declared that they aren&#8217;t going to bother with the consequences of their service on people&#8217;s lives.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t write on social media.  I&#8217;m going to continue to write under my own domain, right up until someone points a gun at my head and informs me that independent websites are no longer allowed.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a website, please consider starting a simple blog and write there instead. You will be free to express there whatever your world view is, supported by whatever evidence you choose. And you can link directly to sources that you believe should be promoted.</p>



<p>By shining one million tiny lights, we can penetrate the darkness of the media web.</p>
