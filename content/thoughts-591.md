<p>The UK is having a general election on Thursday 4 July 2024.  </p>



<p>There are two things you need to take part.  The first is to be on the electoral register before this date, which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">you can do here</a>.  The second is to have photo id on the day, which you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-vote/photo-id-youll-need">find more information about here</a>.</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t voted in an election before, but are eligible, please consider doing so this year.  Collectively, we need to take responsibility for the future direction of this country.</p>
