<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member Mattw321 whose investing journey is deeply intertwined with careers in the armed forces and police.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you and your investment story …</h3>



<p>I joined the Army in 1993, turning 19, and was soon deployed abroad gaining much experience, but also some extra wages – disposable income, which I started to save and invest.&nbsp; Deployed overseas on operations attracted extra pay.&nbsp; I started putting money into shares using Charles Schwab Europe in 1996. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I was in Northern Ireland for the unfortunate Lisburn Barracks bombings of 1996.&nbsp; Unfortunate events shortly afterwards led to near death (thanks Garth), and about a year in medical facilities.  But investing continued, I bought my first (buy-to-let), flat in 1999, alongside investment in stocks online.  They tended to be risky and profitable single stocks, but large losses were also involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a secure pension in the background, alongside that first property purchase near home in Sussex, the shares were a riskier and fun investment (earning over 25% for years).  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Stupidly I sold the first flat after 3 years, sinking more into stocks.  Further significant losses followed, but the portfolio was still reasonable, albeit only in shares and very liquid. &nbsp;</p>



<p>My uncle had been successful with small businesses and I used to speak with him and my father, positively about shares and investments.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By the turn of the century we were able to use home computers and dial up connections to trade online!&nbsp; Gains perhaps lulled me into a false sense of security, staying invested wholly in shares.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I left the Army in 2005, the pension deferred to age 60.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially I thought I could get on without being employed.  With plans of property development et al.&nbsp; But I then lost a lot gambling on CFDs with Barclays, who were not helpful (more to that story).  So decided I’d need to work; and started doing some security contracting.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>While contracting, I was duped and lost most savings with Pacific Continental.  I wrongly thought I would be covered by FCA and the government/police.  Again there’s more to that story but not in this one!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I decided to go for another more secure job with a pension, and joined Sussex Police in 2010, without transferring the Army pension.&nbsp; If I can stick it out that will be another partial pension at age 55.  With lots of experiences!&nbsp;</p>



<p>At around 2013, I bought 2 flats to rent; later selling 1 to buy a house to let within a Ltd Co.&nbsp; Thank you Frazer M for that mortgage advice – that I could buy both of those I had shortlisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I now have ii SIPP &amp; ISA, topping them up when I can.  The ISA got emptied a few times for different things.  And now the SIPP is the main holding.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a bit more about the ISA draining</h3>



<p> I haven’t been saving for anything specific.  I bought my (one-year-old), car outright years ago.  </p>



<p>ISA was also used for assisting deposits buying the two rental flats at the same time (best mortgage advice ever thanks Frazer).  Was looking to buy one, but it was massively delayed so honed in on another.  Ended up with both, one of which I still have, the other was sold to lend the Ltd Co cash for house deposit.  </p>



<p>I’m still not saving for anything specific!  Perhaps saving for bridging before being able to access the SIPP at 57. </p>



<p>The ISA is just over half the value of the SIPP.&nbsp; As it has been used when needed for larger spends (property deposits, cars).   And it will be used when leaving the police, although that pension and rental income should cover a bit more than the basics, the ISA will be there for holidays and bigger spends.  And will later be added to if possible and appropriate tax-wise, from the SIPP.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money? </h3>



<p>To pay off the mortgages!  (My residential flat is the biggest mortgage as it’s cheapest.)  To pay for retirement – or the next chapter.  I have a few different ideas involving property that may develop going forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To generate more to invest in property and holidays, hopefully if and when I meet the one!&nbsp;</p>



<p>How it is spent depends on life at the time.  The aim is to enjoy it as much as possible, I’d like to take time to walk various routes of the Camino de Santiago – did my first last summer.  And discover cruising!  Considering buying in Portugal.  </p>



<p>These also hinge on how upset the world is then and what’s gone on in the meantime.  (We need to start planning for the correction next year too – is it kicking in now or is this pre-Trump slump?!) </p>



<p>Using spreadsheets to forecast, the ISA &amp; SIPP need to get up over £450k for a comfortable retirement and maintained portfolio, to a greater or lesser extent depending on size of withdrawals and costs of future care!  This should be on track.  </p>



<p>Been good learning with the ii community, aiming to reduce the sizes of riskier single stocks.  To invest in more diversified global funds including AI, US and bonds.  I also like the four years in cash plan and that’s what I’ll aim for; albeit reduced amounts having the DB part pensions in the background.   </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown? </h3>



<p>  I’m still accumulating and trying to rationalise the portfolio.  Will retire from police in 5 to 7 years at 55 to 57.  So I have a few irons in the fire, but no wife or children.  My niece will be a wealthy young lady at this rate!  I’d like to spend more time in Portugal or Spain and would consider buying a plot there, health, tax and visa permitting. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You have a few layers of fixed pension kicking in at various ages: police, army then state pension.  How do you plan to use your existing portfolio to top up these when you do decide to stop work? </h3>



<p>I have spreadsheets!&nbsp; The total assets pie chart currently breaks down to include roughly 40% of value in ISA &amp; SIPP.&nbsp; The rest being equity after mortgages in my flat, the rented flat, and the Ltd Co.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And spreadsheets are great for planning finances: tables showing different range of totals, going up each year by 6% or 5%, then 4% after age 60.&nbsp; (Obviously erring on caution and 4% after 60 being less well-managed later on.)&nbsp; Although I get the impression many of you not bored by now and still reading will be over 60!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each year on the spreadsheet shows the differing incomes from work/pension, rentals and the ISA/SIPP.&nbsp; The biggest drain on the ISA is pencilled in for age 55-57, with only the police pension, rental and ISA.&nbsp; Then I can draw on the SIPP from 57, before Army pension at 60, and state (if it still exists), at 67?!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spreadsheet goes forward rather optimistically until age 80!&nbsp; And depending rates of increase and withdrawals, will easily outlast me, leaving for my extended family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mortgage of the rental in my name will be almost paid off at retirement.  Income from that can be increased when needed by decreasing mortgage over-payments.  No income is yet taken from the company rental; all excess used to reduce the mortgage.  That also will be used when required and/or tax-efficient.  </p>



<p>So the plan with the portfolio is to have a significant percentage in bonds and cash during drawdown.  Then make one or two withdrawals a year or as needed.&nbsp; Keeping most in global funds, reducing the gambles with maturity!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding my rental, IF the market is up, AND tenants wish to buy it (or when they move on), AND in next 5 years while I’m still working, I’ll sell, pay the CGT, then add to the SIPP&amp;ISA, pay the other mortgages and add to (start a) cash pot!  And may look to buy in Spain or Portugal.  Hopefully still have motivation for it by 55.  &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p> Money is strange isn’t it?!  I’m known at work as the Yellow Label Man (look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves, apparently).  I love a bargain, but also love spending it on quality.  Bought a one-year-old BMW.  Still have it 8 years later!  Although now about to buy another nearly-new. </p>



<p>Never married, or had any children.  Pros and cons to that!  Be nice to have a partner to build with in Portugal.  &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>I love a good dividend, as well as discounted shares.  But they haven’t been great recently; Phoenix came down from £7, so have reduced that holding although had plenty of tax-free dividends; just purchased Endeavour Mining, Solid State and Power Metal Resources, hoping for uplifts which are yet to materialise.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>I am learning that funds, ETFs and safer stocks should be prioritised.  But I’m still having fun with it anyway!  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Introduced a friend to investments, with a challenge of both investing the same amount in an ISA.  He had 4 stars and 7% within 6 weeks.  I have 3 stars and am down 20% with same starting limits.  The challenge is November to November, Solid State has until then to buck up!&nbsp;</p>



<p>And recently with the ii app, have discovered the US side, also dipping into Canada.  It’s good having a sounding board in the community as well as inspiration.  Unfortunate how ii fleeces on the fx.  Which I have raised with them.  &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What money advice would you pass on to younger people starting out in the armed forces or policing?</h3>



<p> Save!  If you are not yet committed with a young family/struggling with debt; set up a standing order for 5% of your take-home pay, into an ISA.  If you can, set up a SIPP for the same.   </p>



<p>And take advice from an independent.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Don’t get ripped off, don’t necessarily trust companies that are signed up with government guarantees.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many in the Armed forces squander the opportunity to save for property.&nbsp; It’s potentially a fantastic career and pension (or was!)&nbsp; But many just enjoy it too much and, institutionalised, struggle with life outside.&nbsp; Historically the majority of homeless were ex-forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money? </h3>



<p>I probably don’t research enough.  Which is doubly stupid considering my background.  But with picking the best researched stocks, there are still so many other factors effecting prices, you are still often left at the will of the gods.  I use ii, search online at history.  And market, trends, news, competitors, outlook, et al.  No specific sites signed up to.  And would like a go-to site for research. &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community? </h3>



<p>Their hopes and aims for the portfolio.  How they heard about and got into investing for the future.  And the ups and downs of the journey thus far!&nbsp;</p>
