<p>Tom has a thoughtful push back on the <a href="https://endgameviable.com/post/2024/08/does-ai-steal/">question of whether AI steals</a>, which looks at the mechanics of what&#8217;s actually going on in training process:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--7">
<p>It’s a misconception to say that AI steals, copies, or plagiarises. What AI does is <em>consume</em>, in roughly the same way that we do, by reading text, or looking at pictures, or listening to sounds.</p>



<p>It’s true that we have to trust OpenAI and the others when they say they’re not violating any licenses gathering their training data. We don’t have much choice. There’s&nbsp;<em>plenty</em>&nbsp;of material out there for computers to gather freely, though.</p>



<p>It may or may not be infringing someone’s rights to consume a piece of art, be it writing, or a picture, or a song. It depends on what it is, and how it’s presented. But,&nbsp;<em>broadly speaking,</em>&nbsp;if a human is allowed to view a piece of art, a computer probably is, too.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He goes on to acknowledge that machine consumption is on a scale much greater than humans (and maybe that&#8217;s the thing that really bothers people).</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s interesting to focus on the act itself &#8211; if a machine watches a film and produces a review, is that legally, or ethically, any different to me watching a film and writing a review? And if I sell that review to a publisher, perhaps many times over, do I owe the producers of the film anything?</p>



<p>You could argue that AI doesn&#8217;t have a specific end goal in mind when it consumes.  It digests the film in the training process, and only later it might be asked to do a review, give a plot summary, make a recommendation etc.  But that&#8217;s the same with me.  I might go to every new film release, make notes and then only decide later to create new works from some notes.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think any of this really matters in the long term.  In 30 years time, we&#8217;ll find it quite quaint that all we had to worry about was whether generated prompts were theft or not.  In 2050, we&#8217;ll be much more concerned over whether it&#8217;s right that robots can murder humans.</p>
