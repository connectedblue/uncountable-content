<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of scientific concern lately about biofuels and <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/scientist_letter_biofuels">their sustainability</a> which might seem like yet another thoroughly modern problem we&#8217;ve brought upon ourselves.</p>



<p>However, we&#8217;ve been here before.  In the late 19th century, an enormous part of the UK economy was powered by an insatiable demand for biofuel.  By 1900, the resulting pressures on land use, nutrient flow and food security almost pushed us to a point of ecological collapse.  Ironically, it was the switch to fossil fuel which prevented that and allowed the UK to prosper and grow over the twentieth century.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biological engines</h3>



<p>The common framing of the industrial revolution is one of machines replacing muscles.  However, it actually acted as a multiplier on the demand for horses to keep up with growth</p>



<p>By the mid 19th century, horses had already replaced oxen as a faster and more versatile agricultural labourer.  They were well suited to the plough and filled in the gaps left by human labourers migrating to the cities.</p>



<p>The arrival of the steam train may have replaced the stagecoach, but every station along the trunk line required horses to move goods and people to and from the train. By 1900, there were around 3.5m horses deployed across agriculture, freight, urban transport, coal mining and military sectors.</p>



<p>In London, there were estimated to be 50,000+ working horses. The harsh conditions meant they only lived 3-4 years and were dying at the rate of 26,000 a year. Since an animal can only enter service at 3-4 years old, another 100,000 horses would need to be reared in distant pastures to replenish supply.</p>



<p>Each of these biological engines requires daily food, whether they are working or not. They also produce mountains of waste that needs to be disposed of. Urban horses have zero grazing pasture, so 100% of their nutrition needs to be imported into the city.</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re not really talking about a few horses grazing on verges. This was a complex supply chain operating at a national and international scale that pushed land utilisation to breaking point.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Acres of food</h3>



<p>So what did this period of Peak Horse mean for land use and the input costs for the owners?  </p>



<p>A Dray horse in London working 8-10 hours a day needed 12lb of oats for energy, 15lb of hay for fibre and 2lb of beans for protein repair.  An agricultural horse could have maintenance rations of roots in winter, high protein summer grazing and oat supplement during harvest season.</p>



<p>A rule of thumb, given the various crop inputs, yields of the day and pastoral needs, is between 4-5 acres per horse.  So in 1900, around 12-15m acres would be required to support the horse population, or around half of the 32m cultivated acres in Great Britain at the time.</p>



<p>Of course, at this time Ireland was part of the United Kingdom and essentially provided a giant pasture to grow food and rear horses to power the industrial demands.</p>



<p>An approximate breakdown of cultivated land use at the time was as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">Great Britain<br>(million acres)</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">Ireland<br>(million acres)</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Livestock Grazing</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">13.2<br></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">9.0</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"> Livestock Fodder</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">7.8</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">3.0</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Human crop food</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">3.8</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">0.6</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Horse Grazing</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">1.8</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">1.2</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Horse Fodder</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">5.8</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">1.5</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>Total</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><strong>32.4</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><strong>15.3</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A staggering 10.3m acres was dedicated to biofuel production for horses, or 21.5% of the total cultivated land.  And over twice as large as the land dedicated to crops for direct human consumption.</p>



<p>Grasslands are the major supporting capability, acting as the vector to supply nutrient from the soil and energy from the sun into the animal.  The total area of permanent pasture was 29.5m acres, of which 25.2m was dedicated to grazing.</p>



<p>The remaining 4.3m acres were used for hay production, which along with 5.6m acres of hay from temporary arable leys created a total hay crop of 9.9m acres (for both livestock and horses).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ghost acres</h3>



<p>But this only tells part of the story. Our back of the envelope calc tells us that 10.3m acres is not really enough to support a working population of three million horses.</p>



<p>The working horses in urban areas required high calorie and protein diets which could not be met by domestic demand.  These were imported from the plains of the US, Russia, Argentina and India.  </p>



<p>This means a footprint of foreign lands must be dedicated to the industrial needs of the UK, which historians call ghost acres.  The import records from 1900 can be converted to into the acres required (based on achieved yields in those countries) which is summarised in the following table: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><strong>Horse Fodder Imports (&#8216;000 tons)</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><strong>Ghost Acres Required</strong><br><strong>(m)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maize</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">875</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">1.4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Oats</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">900</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">2.5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beans</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">150</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">0.3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hay</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">100</td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right">0.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><strong>2,025</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-right" data-align="right"><strong>4.3</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>An area roughly the size of Yorkshire was required overseas to complete the nutritional picture. In total, 14.6m acres was supporting the nation&#8217;s 3.5m horses.</p>



<p>We can begin to see a system reaching breaking point.  Even hay, a low value bulky item costly to import, could not be entirely provided from domestic supply.  </p>



<p>But, this is only half the problem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The nutrient flow</h3>



<p>The essential nutrients in grassland are Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK).  Somewhere between 70-90% of these ingested nutrients are returned during grazing through dung and urine.  This creates a somewhat closed loop system, although new fertilizer inputs are needed over time.</p>



<p>Up until the early 19th century, a closed loop system also existed in cities. Farmers would take their crop to Haymarket in London and bring back a cart full of manure. However, the scale required soon made this uneconomic and Haymarket closed in 1830. After that, hay was then primarily moved by water via Hay&#8217;s Wharf.</p>



<p>By 1900, around 2.5m tons of hay destined for urban horses was transported away from grasslands, consumed in urban areas and dumped as manure in the streets. </p>



<p>This was the zenith of the market garden era.  They would take this waste 5 miles or so from the urban centre and use its nutritious and thermic properties to create year round vegetables and salads.   They were to be sold back to city residents and the nutrients flushed away forever into the rivers and sea.</p>



<p>Ultimately this cycle created a national NPK deficit which could only be balanced by importing again from foreign lands. There were indirect fertilizers in the form of animal feed for cattle in the grasslands, but also direct fertilizers such as Chilean nitrate, guano, bones and German potash.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brittle Ecosytem</h3>



<p>By any measure, it&#8217;s clear this state of affairs was unsustainable.  The vast bulk of plant based human nutrition had been steadily outsourced since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846.  Domestic land production had specialised into perishable items like meat and dairy, and low value bulk commodities like hay.  Large parts of the nutrient cycle were broken, requiring large amounts of nitrogen to be imported.  </p>



<p>The nation&#8217;s food security and transport network were at risk of being decimated by a break down in international co-operation (which did actually occur during the U-boat blockade of the first world war). And the rising prosperity of other nations competing for these same scarce nutrient resources could drive up prices.</p>



<p>But, as often happens, necessity drives innovation and the technologists invented the internal combustion engine.  Not only was it capable of replacing, and outperforming the horse, it didn&#8217;t require additional surface acres to operate.  Instead, the reservoirs of fossil fuels could be mined, and complete the mechanisation started by steam.</p>



<p>In the cities the decline of the horse was swift. In 1901 there was just a single motor taxi in London. By 1914, the last horse drawn omnibus was taken out of service and 9,000 taxis were on the streets.</p>



<p>In rural areas it took a while longer to replace the agricultural horse.  Early tractors were expensive, and not as efficient as horses, but by the 1950s the technology and economics had improved to replace even those.</p>



<p>This unleashed a one time land dividend of some 10m acres that were no longer needed to produce horse fodder.  Between the wars, large swathes of grassland were ploughed up in a strategic bid to improve self sufficiency.  The Haber-Bosch process enabled vast quantities of nitrates to be synthesised and usher in an era of yield intensification through agrochemicals.</p>



<p>The stage was set for a whole new set of ecological problems to emerge.</p>

<p>This post is the first in a series to summarise some research I have been carrying out on the evolution of grasslands and the impact on biodiversity.  It was inspired by a throw away side comment in <a href="https://www.wottonareacan.org/post/glorious-cotswold-grasslands-project-with-lorna-baggett-from-cotswolds-national-landscape">a talk by Glorious Cotswold Grasslands</a> about the role of grasslands in the transport sector.</p>
