<p>Just saw Zak&#8217;s <a href="https://html-chunder.neocities.org/itg/itg-2024-08-23/">calendar visualisation of the seasons</a> for the garden section of his blog.  </p>



<p>Really neat idea.  It would look excellent with a clickable bar for each post in the section so you can navigate different season&#8217;s posts more easily.</p>
