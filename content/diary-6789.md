<p>I was given a few kilo of seed by <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> before Christmas. It&#8217;s not really the right time of year to sow, but the yellow rattle in the mix would deteriorate soon if not put down.</p>



<p>So I decided to have another go at a strip of grassland I&#8217;ve been trying near my home for the last few years.  It&#8217;s had mixed success &#8211; hedge bedstraw, yellow rattle and oxeye daisy have established, but then it quickly gets overcome by common hogweed and nettles later in the season.  If I can get more grass growing, then it may become more sustainable in future years.</p>



<p>It was a really sunny morning, so i had to work the brush cutter with my back to it so I could keep an eye out for passers by. The vegetation didn&#8217;t take very long to cut, and raked thoroughly afterwards to remove as much nutrient as possible.</p>



<p>I then spread some of the seed from the stash. I&#8217;ve seeded many meadows but I do have a tendency to throw down too much. I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll have a bit of frost or snow in the next week or so which will be good to activate the seed.</p>
