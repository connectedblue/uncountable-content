<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Planned to go up Te Mata, a local peak in a parkland.  A really nice area, but it was howling wind and rain.  We went about 3/4 of the way up the peak before turning back &#8211; you couldn&#8217;t see any of the views and it was a bit miserable.</p>
<p>Went back to the cottage early and lazed around.  Planned a trip to Kapiti Island for when we&#8217;re at the next cottage &#8211; useful to do now because you need a permit to go there which needs to be bought in adavance.</div>
