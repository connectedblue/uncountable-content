<p>The Artocalypse is an online community of artists who collaborate on projects together.  It was started by <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/">Kimberly</a> and I during the 2020 lockdown and it gets stronger each year.</p>



<p>To close out the year, an expo was put together to celebrate all the artists who&#8217;ve inspired us during 2024.  </p>



<p>Check out the expo here:</p>
