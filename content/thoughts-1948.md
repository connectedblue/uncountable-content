<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member AAH who talks candidly about health and money.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you …</h3>



<p>Aged 60 and retired through ill health in 2021 (Diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2015 and had an insurance policy that paid my salary for 5 years).&nbsp; Before stopping work then retiring I worked within Private Banking managing a team supporting clients with their financial and banking needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having worked in a bank for some 39 years in total I was able to build up a reasonable pension that I transferred to a SIPP soon after the pension freedom changes.&nbsp; Whilst the funds were initially managed by a financial management company I wanted to have greater control (as well as reducing costs) and moved initially to HL but more recently moved to ii.</p>



<p>My attitude to money may be described as blasé.&nbsp; It’s not, but from my early days in the Bank I viewed money as the tools I work with as a woodworkers tools are hammers and chisels, money was just a tool so it has no ‘pull’ on me.&nbsp; If I need / wanted something and didn’t have the money for it I’d save up until I did.&nbsp; Buy now, pay later etc is of no interest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>I always invested in my pension and max’d out my Banks Share Option Scheme and Buy as You Earn.&nbsp; As a result of the financial crisis you can guess my Bank shares became close to worthless.&nbsp; It was after this I started to invest small amounts on UK shares in an ISA.&nbsp; I was not massively successful or able to spend time managing my investments so looking back at it I guess I became disenfranchised with investing so to an extent it fell off the radar until the Pension Freedom changes took place in 2015 sparking greater interest for me and my health deteriorating resulting in me moving to a SIPP in 2016</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You’re candid about the challenges you encountered with active investing.&nbsp; Did you or do you also have index funds?</h3>



<p>Some.&nbsp; I consider this a cash pot recognising that it may fluctuate but it does not interest me as all its doing is tracking the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp; The driver for this was keep the costs to a minimum.&nbsp; I invested in VHVG</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I’m currently in drawdown although if you look at my pension you would consider it to continue to be in accumulation.&nbsp; Having retired and with my disability I spend many hours reading the financial market commentary and investigating companies for investing opportunities / portfolio management.&nbsp; Excluding individual company shares the rest of my monies are invested in accumulation / growth funds.&nbsp; Not needing the money on a weekly / monthly basis my objective was to grow my monies to pass onto our daughters.&nbsp; However with the budgetary changes with pensions being included in IHT calculations I’m waiting for the final rules and will need to consider what if any changes I need to consider / action.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What were your considerations when deciding to transfer from a company scheme to your own SIPP? </h3>



<p>When I was working and being part of the Final Salary Group Pension Scheme I was aware that my life was going to be different from what we had planned due to my MS diagnosis.&nbsp; We had originally planned to retire possibly to France.&nbsp; I got a pension transfer value in early 2016 and started to review income/expenditure/potential future value with differing returns/etc and decided we would be better off taking the money and what was important was we would have a legacy to pass on.&nbsp; All decisions were done with numerous conversations over a bottle or 2 of wine with my wife.</p>



<p>Once we had decided to progress it was pretty straightforward.&nbsp; Working in the financial industry I knew qualified advisers and regulated companies I was able to talk things through with initially in theory and then following the prescribed process required when moving out of a defined benefit scheme.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>Monthly expenditure is met with our income / benefits.&nbsp; That said given my circumstances I’m not out often so expenditure is low.&nbsp; Any large purchases are met with lump-sum drawdowns as required.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>My investment style remains growth orientated.&nbsp; I’ve moved away from the UK with circa 70% of my monies invested in the US.&nbsp; This is an approach that has grown over the last few years.&nbsp; I’m not so worried about a downturn in the US.&nbsp; I appreciate that the last 2 years have seen good growth and there is commentary about this coming to an end in 2025.&nbsp; I’m less concerned about this.&nbsp; The Trump administration appears more market orientated and talking business tax reductions will, I think, continue the forward momentum.&nbsp; Value is not something I would consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do have a fun part of my portfolio where I’ll invest small amounts in potentially future winners in the likes of quantum computing, EV battery enhancements and self driving trucks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Health challenges are something none of us can predict.&nbsp; What are some of the financial things we can do now that will help ease the burden if/when we encounter them in the future?</h3>



<p>My health was one of the drivers for moving to a SIPP.&nbsp; My wife is still sore about it “<em>why us</em>” which I completely understand.&nbsp; I’m more pragmatic and described it as “Gods finger has come down and touch me on the head and there was nothing I could have done about it”.&nbsp; There is nothing in my past life that had I changed I would have not ended up with MS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a salary payment policy in place for 5 years has made life easier and I would say to anyone they should consider something like that or some form of critical illness.&nbsp; You never want to need to claim on it but if you need to, it provides the support you need at what is a very stressful time.&nbsp; I just wish I had chosen the option to payout until I was 65 &#8211; that was my 1st investment mistake.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>It would be good to hear from the community on geographical split.&nbsp; I’ve fell into a split similar to the actual market without a planned split.&nbsp; Is it right to follow this or should a different approach be considered.</p>



<p>How often should we re-baseline a portfolio and when.&nbsp; It naturally feel like the start of the year would be the ‘natural’ time to do it but given for example Trump stepping into the presidency in January it maybe be better to wait say 6 months.</p>
