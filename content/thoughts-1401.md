<p>The large blogging platforms such as wordpress, substack, eleventy, hugo etc are well known.  But they all have an entry barrier set high enough to deter a lot of people who just want to write and create.</p>



<p>The rise of low cost hosted solutions like <a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> and <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">bear</a> fill a fabulous gap because not only do you get up and running easily, there is also a community built in which can syndicate your writing to a wider audience.</p>



<p>One feed which I have been following is <a href="https://smol.pub/manual">smol.pub</a>.  It&#8217;s a small journal site that has the feel of a village pub community.  I follow <a href="https://smol.pub/atom.xml">their atom feed</a> in my reader and all sorts of notes crop up from time to time from different people on the platform..</p>



<p>One such person was <a href="https://zkbro.smol.pub/">Zak</a> who started writing on smol about his journey learning linux CLI tools to create a new website.  He exuded a curiosity and creativity in how he went about this so I naturally started to follow posts on <a href="https://html-chunder.neocities.org/">html-chunder</a> &#8211; the new website he was building on the neocities platform.</p>



<p>I think the result looks amazing, especially when you read how it&#8217;s created underneath &#8211; using CLI scripts to create posts on the command line, zola for site generation and neocities CLI to upload the result.</p>



<p>But this morning I saw his latest post about creating an image for the website header section which is a stitched together graph of his exercise stats from Strava over the last seven days. </p>



<p>Such a creative and personal way to add some dynamic interest to your website design.   He&#8217;s learned a whole ton of stuff, but it all started because smol.pub gave him a simple starting point to journal out to the world.  I would certainly have not discovered his site otherwise.</p>



<p>There are thousands of creators doing really innovative things all across the web.  You&#8217;re not going to stumble into them by clicking around facebook or google.  </p>



<p>In my view, the best way to discover these gems is to liberally add sources to your RSS reader at every opportunity.  They will deliver you nuggets of gold.</p>
