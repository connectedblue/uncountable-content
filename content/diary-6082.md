<p>Fantastic opportunity today to work with students from Rednock School on riverfly monitoring.  We planned to use the new Lister Road site, which happens to be just behind the school.  I headed over there first thing to clear some of the vegetation with loppers and then met Tony in reception to meet the students.</p>



<p>The format for the morning was to go and collect samples first and then analyse them during two subsequent biology lessons.  Around 15 students took part, so we made our way down to the river, donned wellies and went through the safety briefing.</p>



<p>We had four nets, so after a demo of how to do the kick and hand samples, they split into groups to collect in different parts of the river under the bridge.  We collected them into a couple of buckets that represented the upstream and downstream habitats.</p>



<p>After carrying them back to the school, Tony and I then set up the lab for the lesson with sample trays, pipettes, magnifying glasses, identification guides and recording sheets.  We then had two back to back lessons with different groups of students who attended the collection.</p>



<p>We gave a short intro about the lifecycle of riverfly and the species we are looking for to indicate good river health.  Then they got to work sorting out what was collected.  The samples turned out to be very species rich and one group found all eight species (something I&#8217;ve never seen before).  A nice lot of mayflies, but only a few cased caddisfly.</p>



<p>The students were excellent &#8211; smart, engaged and asking lots of great questions.  They have done a lot of other monitoring as part of their studies and will use this data to produce some biodiversity indexes in future lessons.</p>



<p>Its great that the school have now incorporated this into the curriculum and that the local community can get involved to help inspire the students with citizen science.  I look forward to helping the teachers run future sessions.</p>
