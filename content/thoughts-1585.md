<p>Just stumbled into Matthew Taylor&#8217;s article on creating <a href="https://matthewjamestaylor.com/custom-tags">custom HTML tags</a> which I want to start applying as a way to structure more complex blog post content in a way that doesn&#8217;t embed WP theme specific information.</p>



<p>His site also has some rather simple and brilliant responsive layout markup patterns.</p>
