<p>Checked on the three rafts along the Cam for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  There hasn&#8217;t been any mink spotted for a very long time which is good news, but there is also a lack of any other species recently.</p>



<p>Today was no different, no field signs on any of the rafts.  It may well be that the clay cartridge needs replenishing, so I&#8217;ll meet with Pete at some point to do that.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I held the first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> of the Autumn term.  The regulars returned and carried on where they left off with projects.  I&#8217;ve been particularly impressed with a couple of boys who have been digging into the Javascript code for a game and figured out how to change levels and other aspects of the gameplay.</p>



<p>I forgot to take my glasses to the library, which was a real struggle.  I borrowed a giant magnifying glass from the library which wasn&#8217;t terribly good but better than without.  Luckily the children were very patient with me while I scanned their code looking for errors. </p>
