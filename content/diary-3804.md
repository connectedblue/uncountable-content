<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Booked a wine tour for the afternoon of the 8th.  It&#8217;s going to be 30C here today so thought it would be a bit hot for wine today.</p>
<p>Went to Napier in the morning &#8211; lots of art deco buildings in the town centre.  Much nicer than the towns in northern new zealand.  In the afternoon we booked a trip to see the gannet colony at Kidnappers Cove.  Very impressive and we could get within two feet of the whole colony. The whole peninsula is great &#8211; it&#8217;s private property owned by a billionaire. </div>
