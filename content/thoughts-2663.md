<p>Although I&#8217;ve been investing purposefully since 1998, I have to admit I&#8217;ve never really experienced as prolonged market highs as we have been seeing lately (September 2025 at time of writing).  </p>



<p>Normally my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="228">temperament is quite well regulated</a>, but there are definitely new emotions in play as both the FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 have regularly broken daily records over the past two years or so.</p>



<p>It seems hard to believe that over 27 years of investing I wouldn&#8217;t have seen more like this.  But with dot com, global financial crisis and covid, there really haven&#8217;t been a whole lot of highs.  </p>



<p>I know the S&amp;P has been on a tear since 2017, but I only <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/us-and-uk-portfolio-allocation/" data-type="post" data-id="1878">diversified across there</a> in 2022.  But lately I&#8217;ve been experiencing the same internal questions as every other investor &#8211; do I sell my holdings now and wait for the inevitable hard landing before going back in?</p>



<p>By contrast, not selling at the bottom is actually an easy strategy. During dotcom, my accumulated pot was relatively small, so no real pain on balance and as a net contributor I was getting as good price. GFC was a bit tougher &#8211; by then I had a reasonable pot, but it happened so quickly, there wasn&#8217;t any time to react. Again, I was a net contributor, earning good money and not intending to draw down for many years. So I stayed invested and carried on accumulating.</p>



<p>Covid was a different matter.  I actually <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/stopping-work/" data-type="post" data-id="575">stopped work in August 2019</a>, so seeing my portfolio drop 32% six months later was somewhat sobering, especially as I no longer contributing net new money.  However, those feelings were more than offset with my experience, and I knew over the next 30-40 years of drawdown the market would recover (and I had <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">four years of expenses in cash</a> which cushioned any immediate impulse to do anything rash with the portfolio).</p>



<p>But recently, I find myself questioning whether I should break all the rules, exit the market, and wait to hoover up the gains in a few months when the rest of the market is burning.  Time the market, in other words.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s much tougher being at the top than the bottom.</p>



<p>There are three principle reasons why I won&#8217;t:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I honestly have no clue whether the market is over valued or not. I know for sure it will be higher than today in 15 years, but have literally no clue where it will finish in 2025 or 2026. There are still many, many all-time highs ahead of us.</li>



<li>You don&#8217;t make money by getting out when the market is high &#8211; you only bank gains when you fully re-buy at a lower price.  And my recent experience is not good on that one.  During Covid, I had new money from my recently finished employment waiting to be fed into an ISA.  I did not do this in April 2020 when the FTSE was 5,700.  Instead I made the move around December when it was 6,500 (yes a discount to the 7,600 it had been at the start of the year, but hardly evidence of wolf-of-wall-street-like behaviour by yours truly).</li>



<li>I don&#8217;t need to.  My <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/modelling-your-financial-future/" data-type="post" data-id="2185">forecast model out to age 100</a> uses very conservative assumptions on investment return versus inflation and the chances of running out of money for <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">non-discretionary expenses</a> are slim to zero.  On top of that, I&#8217;m still sitting on a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">four year expenses cash buffer</a> (having topped up recently in April 2025) so there is no short term pressure on funding spend for most of the rest of this decade.</li>
</ul>



<p>Will I regret this decision in a few months or years (especially after writing this post)?  It never feels good to see your portfolio cut in two, even though I know that will happen at least three times over the next 40 years.</p>



<p>In times such as these, I think it&#8217;s worth revisiting <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-accumulate-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="676">why you accumulate wealth</a> in the first place.  For me, it was always about gaining control over time.  I don&#8217;t think a market correction would impede my ability to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocate time</a> as I wish.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s the real win.</p>
