<p>Sara asked whether we have <a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/06/do-you-have-any-private-parts-off-your-site/">private parts of our websites</a>, and what do we use them for.</p>



<p>My principal private service is my RSS, which consists of two parts:  <a href="https://freshrss.org/index.html">FreshRSS</a> for the reader itself and <a href="https://www.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/">FullTextRSS</a> to convert partial feeds to full feeds so I don&#8217;t have to leave the reader.</p>



<p>There is an option to display your feed publicly in FreshRSS, but I don&#8217;t do this to avoid legal problems (I don&#8217;t have the right to republish other people&#8217;s content on my site).  I sometimes give friends the aggregated feed links so they can put in their readers though.</p>



<p>My RSS stream is by far the main way I consume content on the web.  I&#8217;m not on social media.  So having control of exactly what content I want to see is critically important.</p>



<p>As a bonus, this is also the way I interact with youtube.  It turns out that if you push a youtube channel RSS through FullTextRSS, then you end up with an embedded video in your feed which doesn&#8217;t carry ads.  You also get the advantage of seeing everything in your stream that you subscribe to (unlike the youtube app which only presents you a subset of your subscriptions plus a load of other stuff you don&#8217;t follow).  </p>



<p>So, I suppose my website has turned into my own social media platform.  I use it to create content in <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/rss-feed/" data-type="post" data-id="135">my blogs</a>, host <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/about-me/" data-type="post" data-id="132">my profile</a> and consume through my reader.  <br></p>
