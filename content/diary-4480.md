<p>It&#8217;s been a month since I last checked the rafts for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>, so after an early 8am haircut, I made my way down to the Cam to see what&#8217;s been happening.</p>



<p>Otter speint was present on both rafts, although I didn&#8217;t record any footprints of note.  There was a potential sign of mink, but not really that conclusive.  We&#8217;re keeping a heightened eye on this section of river, because we&#8217;re sure there might be one that has returned recently.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I headed to the library for my first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> of the week.  They continue to amaze with the effort they put into coding and the results they achieve.  I was particularly impressed with one boy who conducted a self study research with AI on how to make his website look more modern (it had some rudimentary CSS applied to otherwise plain HTML).</p>



<p>This took him off to lots of different sites to explore fonts, colours, icons and various other snippet which he copied back into his site.  This is quite remarkable for a ten year old, who codes web pages from scratch.</p>
