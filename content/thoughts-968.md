<p>Simon has put up a new <a href="https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/lets-normalize-creativity">manifesto to normalise creativity</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--31">
<p>Everything we do as people is&nbsp;<em>creative</em>&nbsp;&#8211; it’s the essence of life and consciousness. The thoughts you’re having right now about this idea &#8211; maybe you disagree and are formulating a rebuttal &#8211; are spontaneously arising in your mind and you’re using the ideas that fit together to create a belief that you can think and feel. That’s creative. That’s making something.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is bang on.  Artists do not have the monopoly on creativity, just as religious people don&#8217;t on morals.</p>



<p>We call certain people &#8220;creatives&#8221;.  Or even worse, &#8220;content creators&#8221;.  Labels that reinforce a perception that creativity is for other people.</p>



<p>Perhaps there is a fear that creations have to be useful to others.  But that&#8217;s a very high bar to aim for. If you can create something for yourself, then you are creative.  </p>



<p>There is perhaps a difference between making and creating.  You might make the same lunch every day.  A repeatable, necessary task that doesn&#8217;t feel all that inspiring.  But if, one day, you add a new topping, then you have crossed over from making to creating.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be following Simon&#8217;s posts closely in the coming weeks to see how this idea develops.</p>
