<p>At some point, it seems everyone has to come to a conclusion about whether they are woke or not.  In reaching my decision, I considered two major factors.</p>



<p>The first is that woke experts have determined that everything is woke.  The BBC is woke. Universities are woke.  Sainsbury&#8217;s is woke.   Coutts is woke.  So, quite simply, I want to be on the side of everything.  I don&#8217;t actually need everything, but on the other hand, I don&#8217;t want to have to exclude something from my lifestyle.  </p>



<p>I understand that GB news is not woke, and neither is Piers Morgan, but honestly, I&#8217;m happy to live without them. It&#8217;s everything else I don&#8217;t want to miss out on. So being woke enables me to participate in everything if I so choose.</p>



<p>The second is particular to the UK and a demographic here called gammon.  Because of my age, gender, class and race, I could quite easily be mistaken for gammon to the casual observer.  And I don&#8217;t want that as an identity.  It&#8217;s fine for some, just not for me.  So being woke excludes me from being mistaken for gammon.</p>



<p>It may be one day there&#8217;s a middle ground, but in this divisive world, you have to be one thing or another.  You can&#8217;t be a little bit gammony and a little bit wokey.  So I&#8217;m happy to park my bus firmly on the woke stand.</p>



<p>In case there are any woke experts out there who think I&#8217;m just jumping on a bandwagon (which would, of course, be a very woke thing to do) then just go <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">take a look at my diary</a>. </p>



<p>Still convinced I&#8217;m not woke?</p>
