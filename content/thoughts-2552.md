<p>I&#8217;m participating again in a brilliant and simple idea from <a href="https://birming.com/2025/06/01/junited/">Robert Birming</a> to connect and share during the month of June.</p>



<p>I will update this post throughout June with links that inspire and deserve to be shared.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I feel the same when I buy a bag of crisps with my petrol and <a href="https://musingsfromatangledmind.com/2025/06/01/simple-things-that-make-you-happy/">Snack Like No One’s&nbsp;Watching</a> courtesy of Musings From a Tangled Mind.</li>



<li>Cal compares digital lifestyle to ultra processed food in <a href="https://calnewport.com/are-we-too-concerned-about-social-media/">Are We Too Concerned About Social Media?</a>.  I think blogging is the equivalent of eating your greens.</li>



<li>Tiramisu is <a href="https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/questioning-the-dedication/">questioning the dedication</a> we put into our routines and wonders if completeness is a necessary goal</li>



<li>Thomas Ptacek thinks <a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</a> and I have to agree.  Having spent a week vibe coding to produce a pretty comprehensive personal application, I&#8217;m seeing the future.  </li>



<li>In a similar vein, Mike Masnick asks us to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/03/stop-begging-billionaires-to-fix-software-build-your-own/">Stop Begging Billionaires To Fix Software — Build Your Own</a> , giving an example of a personal productivity application he built with no coding knowledge.</li>



<li>I&#8217;ve been thinking I need a link manager, so was interested in<a href="https://winther.sysctl.dk/self-hosting-linkding-for-managing-my-postroll/"> Self-hosting linkding for managing my postroll</a> by winther.  I love running docker apps on my server.</li>



<li>Simon&#8217;s very brilliant roundup of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/6/six-months-in-llms/#atom-entries">The last six months in LLMs, illustrated by pelicans on bicycles</a>.</li>



<li>Peter found out that <a href="https://ruk.ca/content/bots-are-eating-my-blog-lunch">Bots Are Eating My Blog for Lunch</a> and only 14% of his site visitors are actually human.  There are some things I&#8217;d rather not know.</li>
</ul>
