<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Had a leisurely start to the day and headed off down to Pancake rocks at around 11.30.  They&#8217;re about 30Km south of where we are and are part of the national park.  They are lots of strange limestone formations, shaped in layers that look like pancakes.  There are also blow holes which can be seen early in the morning or late at night.  The coastal scenery was fantastic.</p>
<p>We continued on down to Greymouth and then turned off towards Reefton &#8211; an old coal mining town. After having an ice cream by the river we set back on the loop towards Westport.</div>
