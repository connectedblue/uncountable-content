<p>Kathy organised a late afternoon trip up at Stinchcombe hill to continue the survey of the grassland started a <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/05/scorching-grid-squares/" data-type="post" data-id="5945">couple of weeks back</a>.</p>



<p>This time we went for the steep sided bank below the walker&#8217;s car park which was mown with robo mowers during the winter and raked off.  This is then a good opportunity to see what was lurking under the dogwood and other scrub, waiting to spring forth when the shading is removed.</p>



<p>There were a few new faces joined the group which was good to see, and the weather was pretty sunny when we started. We quickly discovered many good indicator species, including common milkwort and burnet saxifrage. There was still a fair bit of scrub starting to pop through, but this survey will provide good evidence to keep the ongoing management going.</p>



<p>We stopped after an hour for a water break and the weather had turned more ominous.  This rain that we&#8217;d be promised might finally come down.  We managed to get a couple more grid squares done after that, but the heavens opened and we just about managed to get back to the cars without too much of a soaking.</p>
