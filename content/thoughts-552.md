<p>I characterise my investment style as passive-aggressive.  </p>



<p>My <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/investing-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="452">investment strategy</a> is 100% passive. Currently I split my portfolio between UK and US index funds, and seek only to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/" data-type="post" data-id="456">achieve market return</a> over all future time periods. Nothing more, and certainly nothing less.</p>



<p>My <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="228">contribution strategy</a> is 100% aggressive.  When I was working, I used the excess between my income and consumption to maximise the amounts placed into tax free investment vehicles.  I always selected dividend accumulation funds so any cash returned was immediately re-invested back into the index.</p>



<p>Now that I&#8217;ve stopped work and not earning additional investment funds, I&#8217;m aggressive in cash management.  I keep 4 years of future lifestyle spend in cash and keep everything else in passive equity funds.</p>



<p>For me, four years of cash is enough buffer to allow me to sleep at night and still be passive aggressive. </p>
