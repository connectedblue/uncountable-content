<p>The <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/03/outdoor-first-aid-day-one/" data-type="post" data-id="4456">second part</a> of an outdoor first aid qualification, so another long day with an early start.  I picked up Martin and we got over to Stonehouse just before 9am ready to get stuck in.</p>



<p>The course is delivered by Martin from <a href="https://www.borderlandsfirstaid.co.uk/">Borderlands First Aid</a>, who is an excellent and knowledgeable instructor.  The day two content was about burns, scalds, bleeding, medical conditions and the secondary survey.</p>



<p>One particularly useful section was on cardiac arrest, heart attack and stroke and how to spot the difference between them, as well as the action to take as a first aider.</p>



<p>There were also many more scenarios to play out as practical exercises.  These were extremely useful to cement the concepts, but even in a training setting, quite stressful.  As a first aider, you turn up to a scene and you don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s happened so there&#8217;s a procedure to go through to ascertain the next steps.</p>



<p>We all passed at the end of the day and the qualification certificate will be sent through in the next fortnight.  There&#8217;s also a very comprehensive manual provided, which I&#8217;m going to have to re-read every few months to refresh some of the material.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re involved in any kind of outdoor activity, especially in a group setting, I recommend going on one of these courses.</p>
