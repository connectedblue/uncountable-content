<p>In 1998, aged 30, I made a what turned out to be a major decision, to start investing so that I could retire early. I had saved some money, learned some <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/" data-type="post" data-id="289">financial modelling</a> from a few years as an actuary and had been paying into a company pension scheme.</p>



<p>Other than that, I had no real strategy for how to achieve <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/" data-type="post" data-id="529">financial independence</a>. So I formulated a 60 year strategy to guide me which went like this:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>From age 30-60, save an additional amount each year which would double in real terms over 30 years.  </li>



<li>At age 60, withdraw the amount I put in at 30 to whatever it had grown to. At age 61, withdraw the amount I put in at 31. And so on.</li>
</ul>



<p>The insight for me in this strategy is that I&#8217;m always a long term investor &#8211; at age 59, I&#8217;m still putting in an amount that won&#8217;t be touched until age 89.  So there&#8217;s no need to change investment strategy just because I&#8217;m close to retirement.</p>



<p>Also, the aim of &#8220;doubling in real terms&#8221; was somewhat plucked out the air.  The ISA allowance at the time was £7,000, and I figured that £14,000 in 1998 money would go a long way to supporting me (especially if supplemented by a pension).</p>



<p>But, it turned out to have two important consequences which are still with me today.</p>



<p>Firstly, doubling over 30 years is a get rich slow scheme. So I could discard all notions of chasing return and looking for hot tips. I simply didn&#8217;t need to. I had enough runway of time to let compounding do all the heavy lifting. All I had to do was stick to the plan and <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/" data-type="post" data-id="456">the market would do the rest</a>.</p>



<p>That was when I selected index funds with dividend accumulation as the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/being-passive-aggressive/" data-type="post" data-id="552">core investing approach</a>. I only bought FTSE100 tracker funds, but through various companies to not over rely on one fund manager who might hit trouble. I&#8217;ll do another blog post to dive into the rationale behind FTSE100, and how that differs today.</p>



<p>The second consequence of the strategy was that doubling in real terms over 30 years actually equates to an average real return of +2.3%pa over inflation.  This was a mathematical calculation that I didn&#8217;t actually do until very recently.  However, in my modelling spreadsheets that I&#8217;ve been using for many years, I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/" data-type="post" data-id="289">using +2%pa</a> as a conservative number from my actuarial training days.  </p>



<p>So my &#8220;gut feel&#8221; target investment return would have supported my cashflow needs.  As it happens, 25 years in, my average real return has been around +3.2%pa, so a good headroom.</p>



<p>Needless to say, my 60 year plan has evolved somewhat (the most striking difference being that I stopped work age 51, not 60).  But the important thing is to have a plan, stick to it, and evolve it as you have more information.</p>
