<p>Tahimik is pondering how to <a href="https://tahimik.com/journal/did-it-really-happen-if-you-cant-remember-it">remember things that fade quickly</a> from memory.  A particular example is music concerts and the extent you should record them while you&#8217;re there, or be &#8220;in the moment&#8221;:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--17">
<p>Just this weekend, I saw My Chemical Romance. I had seen MCR a couple of times before, back in 2011 and 2022. I barely remember the 2011 concert. I don&#8217;t remember any of the actual performance. I just remember looking back at my friend in the middle of &#8220;Welcome to the Black Parade&#8221; and singing the lyrics at each other. This was before filming or taking pictures on your phone was really a thing (I don&#8217;t think I even had a smartphone yet), so recording never came to my mind. But I really wish I somehow remembered more of the concert.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That&#8217;s essentially why I <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">keep a diary</a> in another part of this site.  If something significant happens on a particular day, I write up a short entry and include a photo or two.  It really helps to put things in context, and I like to scroll back and re-read previous activities.</p>



<p>I started writing it around February 2023, and at the time of writing, have kept it current for around 18 months.  But I also have a couple of other interesting use cases for it as well.</p>



<p>I write entries for <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/past-days/">days long in the past</a> that I remember well.  For example, here&#8217;s <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/1983/05/the-damned-and-madness/">an entry from 1983</a> about a concert I went to.  And another <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/1989/04/caving-accident/">from 1989 about a traumatic accident</a> I had while caving.</p>



<p>This helps to preserve memories I have now of the past.  I try to recall as many details of the day as possible.</p>



<p>Another diary project I am doing is to write a series of <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/annual-reflection/">annual reflections</a> on 31 December of every year in my life.  This helps to signpost and summarise the broad strokes my life has taken.  My favourite is <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/1969/12/reflections-on-1969/">this one from 1969</a>, which is actually my earliest memory, at just over one year old.</p>



<p>Blog software is obviously a fantastic ready made tool to manage a diary.  You don&#8217;t just have to write contemporary entries, it can also house a lifetime of experiences.  </p>



<p>The only thing I would recommend is keeping it separate from any other general purpose blog you might have.  It&#8217;s got a distinct purpose, and mixing in general journal writing would just confuse and dilute the power of the diary to record those precious moments.</p>
