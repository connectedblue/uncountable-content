<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member Deflationary boom who shares his fascinating journey from fund manager to farmer and how he manages his own money instead of other people&#8217;s.</p>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about yourself</h3>



<p>I’m a 45 year old ex-fund manager. People would always mis-hear my profession as ‘Fun manager’ or ‘Farm manager’ in a desperate attempt to latch on to something that a) they could understand and b) didn’t bore them senseless. I didn’t find being a Fund Manager boring but it was very stressful and after twenty years of it I burnt out. I am now a Farm Manager.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>At 21, when I got my first job in the industry. I was a humanities student before that and had no idea about the markets. It was a steep learning curve and I made every mistake in the book. Multiple times.</p>



<p>Since I’ve stopped investing professionally, I’ve begun enjoying it again. I love watching the markets (r)evolve every day and ii Community is a nice forum for discussing some of this. My family and friends have next to no interest so thanks to everyone on the platform for your thoughts and chat!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>To cover the living expenses of my family (four dependents) and to maximise capital to put into soil or community projects.</p>



<p>I aim to participate in up markets and outperform in down markets. That’s what I always said at work but it was easier said than done. I think I have more idea of how to do it now.</p>



<p>I prefer managing my own money than other people’s. I feel more unconstrained, both in taking risk and being able to buy any asset I want rather than what I was hired to focus on. At the same time I feel more in control of my risk. Perhaps because I don’t have to toe a line and because&nbsp; I’ve got more options when the brown stuff hits the hairdryer.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Accumulation/pre-retirement. A certain level of capital loss would be unsustainable for me so I have to have some hedging instruments even in a bull market like we’re currently experiencing. However I am still aiming primarily for capital appreciation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Although it might be some time off, do you think you will significantly change your investment style when you reach drawdown?</h3>



<p>When major liabilities are less than 13 years away I expect to increase my investment in bonds. For periods longer than 13 years, equities have always delivered higher returns with lower risk the longer you hold them. Bonds are the opposite. I’d always rather have capital appreciation than simple ‘yield’, the latter often hiding a depreciating asset. But when you’re close to the period when you vitally need the cash, you can’t gamble with short term returns or market fluctuations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>Encouraging my wife to participate in the annual household budget. This fails. I’ve built sufficient provision to cover our living expenses if carefully invested. This is working out so far but the markets have been unusually helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Household finance planning is a whole topic in itself.&nbsp; Do you worry about what would happen if you suddenly weren’t here tomorrow?</h3>



<p>I’ve told my wife to put 90% into the Vanguard 80% life strategy and 10% into Games Workshop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>A painful, Damascene conversion from Value investor to Growth investor 5 years ago.</p>



<p>As a professional investor I had to focus on Emerging Markets: India, China, Brazil, South Africa etc. 80% of the companies in these markets are Industrial, Manufacturing or Commodity companies.</p>



<p>The fact is &#8211; these companies (and therefore these countries) only really outperform during periods of inflation. 2002-2008 when I started investing was one such period. It was a very unhelpful benchmark for me to hark back to. The recent post Covid era was another. If you look over longer periods of time you realise periods of inflation average out at only about two years in ten. Generally ignited by the central banks through money printing in the aftermath of a deflationary crash (the mistake they made in 2022 was Covid – unlike 2008 – wasn’t a deflationary crash as activity continued online and we didn’t have a deflationary corporate debt bubble).</p>



<p>As a cheerleader for the Emerging Market asset class I turned into one of the characters in Waiting for Godot – endlessly talking about how inflation is just around the corner and the motley collection of steel, oil and hearing aid manufacturers I owned will do great when it finally comes. It was never worth it. As they say, value investors end up having the last laugh but it’s a very expensive last laugh.</p>



<p>The person who made me confront this was David Scott at Cha-Am advisers. A brilliant, funny, earthy Scotsman who isn’t afraid of offending people and calling out all the bullshit of the talking heads. He is great both at large frames for inflation, the market cycle and psychology and individual stock picking and what company and industry turns and ratios tell you about economic conditions.</p>



<p>David convincingly argues that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon (Freidman) rather than primarily to do with shortages. We always innovate better and cheaper ways out of our problems so invest with the cost reducing innovators, avoid the old industry dinosaurs. Buy cashflow producing (or soon to be producing), asset light growth companies; avoid capital hungry, asset intensive rust buckets.</p>



<p>I felt uncomfortable talking to David, almost embarrassed. I knew by then that what he said was right but I couldn’t admit it because my portfolio was all tilted the other way.Now I manage my own money I can invest where I want. America is 80% service industry companies, only 20% rust buckets for example. I can short oil and copper directly. Buy Bonds as ballast. And buy Games Workshop, the golden goose that keeps on giving!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the key features of your approach to give you more protection against long term domestic inflation?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>I’m not worried about inflation at the moment as a) I believe we’ve had our ‘two years in ten’ inflationary blip and b) I think the dominant historical trend is deflation &#8211; generally benign but occasionally dangerous [see my Mammoth Shortages post on ii community]. I think the danger right now is in holding inflation protective assets rather than deflation protective assets. We’re still fighting the last war (2022-2024) and fearing a return to the 1970s rather than realising we’re in the deflationary 1980s where equities and bonds did well simultaneously while commodities and gold did badly. I’m actively short oil and copper, have exited inflation beneficiary equities or countries (I’m considering shorting overvalued, low growth India on this basis once it hits another high) and am long deflationary growth equities (technology and services in the US and UK).</p>



<p>We took some time off to travel the world after I left fund management. Most of the countries we went through had inflation rates of &gt;40% at the time. My son asked what inflation was so I tried to give him a monetarist explanation of it. It’s obviously a simplified one but expresses my view on it:</p>



<p>Monetarist Dad: Imagine you’re on the moon where there’s a single apple tree with one apple on it and next to it there’s a £1 coin. Nothing else is on the moon. How much does the apple cost?</p>



<p>Sceptical Son: £1?</p>



<p>MD: Yes. Now imagine the King of the moon magically produces another pound coin so that there are two pounds on the moon but only one apple. How much does that apple cost?</p>



<p>SS: £2?</p>



<p>MD: Exactly. That’s inflation. Same amount of stuff, more money.</p>



<p>SS: Why don’t they just grow another apple tree?</p>



<p>MD: They usually do.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How has investing impacted your approach to managing your farm business?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Farms don’t make money, they’re a labour of love. Even more so for those who are trying to make their whole living off a farm without any other income producing assets. Returns on investment of 0.5-3% would be kicked out of bed as an investment idea. I can afford to involve myself in this, proper farmers can’t and yet they still do it. Alan Savory’s Holistic Management is an excellent book on how to manage farming with a view to all the bottom lines though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regenerative farming (old style farming in new clothes) is fascinating and I love helping put it into practice with the aim of reducing the amount of topsoil lost in the winter floods, rebuilding soil health and moving towards nutrition dense food. It&#8217;s great to do something in the physical world where you get your hands dirty whilst making the world a bit cleaner. Finance is often the opposite.   </p>



<p>One similarity with the market is in the interconnected marketplace of soil microbiology. A single stalk of barley channels carbon from the air into the soil, exchanging it with bacteria for the particular cocktail of nutrients it needs. Well connected soil can signal to microbes hundreds of metres away exactly what that particular stalk of barley needs and transfer the nutrients to it. This decentralised market system is way more complex than our top down, clumsy efforts to dis-intermediate (and therefore kill off) the micro-organisms by dumping three chemicals onto the plants: N, P, K.</p>



<p>As a libertarian, market oriented personality I obviously love this analogy. But the fact is I’ve now become a state employee. If you take subsidies for farming (and it’s a person of impressive principle who doesn’t), this is effectively what you become. But to my surprise, I can’t help admiring the latest government subsidies (SFIs). Imho we may have the best farm subsidy regime in the world now but you wouldn’t know it from the press. Or the poor beleaguered farmers who are hanging on by doing it in the industrial way and being criticised for it too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp; Please share links for others to follow</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>David Scott at Cha-Am (Aletheia). See notes on David above. He is iconoclastic and uncannily accurate. I’ve come across so much hot air and waffle in my time. David is that rare exception.<a href="https://www.aletheia-capital.com/analysts/473"> https://www.aletheia-capital.com/analysts/473</a></li>



<li>The Financial Times: without wanting to be disrespectful, this is 80% hot air and waffle (honourable exceptions include Janan Ganesh and some guest contributors). But it’s very useful if used as a contrarian indicator! I read it cover to cover every morning as a guide to sentiment and the market cycle. The purpler the prose the closer we are to a top or bottom. It’s also worth reading a copy from a year ago (you can do this on the digital app) to see which trends have enduring momentum and which are temporary.</li>



<li>Sheetsfinance: this is a google Sheets add on that allows me to track my portfolio stats. I compile the median FCF yield, dividend yield and ROE of my portfolio. New stocks have to beat the median to get in. I also check the RSI of my holdings/watchlist on a weekly basis for opportunities to add. I’ve also set it up to give sentiment, cycle and inflation reads on the wider market. When these look very elevated I try to increase cash and decrease equity holdings. Yes, I’m trying to market time a bit. Muppet.</li>



<li>ii Community app: It’s great seeing a graph of my overall portfolio. Again, gives me clues as to when I could be adding or pulling back. Seeing where I’ve bought or sold a stock is also good as a corrective to hindsight bias. I like seeing where I’ve managed to buy a stock low and being embarrassed&nbsp; by the times I’ve done the opposite.</li>



<li>Trading economics (<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/">https://tradingeconomics.com/</a>): this is a great simple dashboard of all the movements in commodities, forex, indices, stocks, bonds and crypto. It also has some great macroeceonomic data on it by country. Nice clean interface.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I love hearing when someone has changed their mind on something. Be it a single stock or a whole way of investing. As Keynes said: ‘When the facts change, I change my mind – what do you do sir?’. If Keynes can do it, so can the rest of us.</p>



<p>The other unique thing about the markets is that if I’m wrong, there’s evidence to prove it. The performance figures are in black and white.</p>



<p>This makes ii Community unique compared to other social media sites. The culture wars involved opinions hurled at the other side with a couple of graphs as proof. On ii community I have to put my money where my mouth is. If I’m wrong, there’s evidence it prove it. Of course I can say I haven’t been proven right ‘yet’ but ultimately it&#8217;s my money and it&#8217;s in my interest to be right. If someone on the forum is saying something that I disagree with but they’re performing, I should take note.</p>



<p>Crypto is an example – I don’t understand it, it doesn’t fit my frame and it looks like a bubble to me. But lots of people have done well out of it and understand it better than me. Well done them! In terms of pure historical performance – I’ve been wrong and they’ve been spectacularly right. As David Scott says – ‘A bubble is just a bull market that I’m not in’.</p>
