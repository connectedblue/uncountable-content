<p>Set to be the hottest day of the year so far, I set out early for my regular river monitoring for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  I could feel burning on the back of my neck even before 9am as I walked along the bank of the Cam.</p>



<p>Along the way, I pulled some <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/himalayan-balsam/">Himalayan Balsam</a> &#8211; a token effort given it has taken hold there.  If we ever do manage to establish a community group to monitor the Cam, then we need to look strategically in starting with Balsam at the top of the catchment.</p>



<p>Nothing major to report on the rafts, although when I approached the second one, I heard a distinct plop and splash, but I couldn&#8217;t see through the willow whether it was a water vole or not.</p>



<p>After lunch I headed down to Jacob&#8217;s House to catch up with Ann-Marie and Leah on the progress of <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a>.  It&#8217;s been a few weeks since we launched and things are building nicely.  We discussed ways to categorize content, encourage more followers, get more local business involved and build out the events.</p>



<p>Straight after, I held the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> in the library. A lot of the Monday children will be too old for the club next term, so I need to think about how they can continue to use the library resources for self study going forward. They continue to be immensely creative and curious, so I have no doubt that they will continue their digital journey under their own steam.</p>
