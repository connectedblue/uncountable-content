<p>Ruslan has written an excellent summary of how the <a href="https://rosipov.com/blog/ai-and-the-new-junior-engineer/">role of junior engineer will evolve</a> with AI and also some very practical steps on how this transition can be navigated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--1">
<p>Let’s be clear: the old model, where experience was often gained through highly repetitive tasks, was never perfect. </p>



<p>It was simply the established way, the way of our ancestors: software engineers learn some math and not-particularly-useful concepts in college (or take a coding bootcamp, which is much faster, and in my experience, produces similar results), join a company, shadow more senior engineers, write some terrible code, make a few expensive mistakes for the company to absorb, and eventually graduate into productive developers of software. </p>



<p>But like any system with inherent inefficiencies, this progression system was always susceptible to disruption.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I learned to code in 1981, in BASIC and Z80 machine code.  I added FORTRAN, SQL, perl, python and HTML in the 90s, and in the last decade or so, R, PHP and JavaScript.</p>



<p>Apart from a brief period at the very start of my career (and bizarrely towards the end), I never wrote code for money.  I think that&#8217;s why I never fell out of love with coding &#8211; it was something I did only for enjoyment.</p>



<p>So, of course, I embrace AI today.  I remember a strange realisation early in 2025 that I would never actually be coding without it in the future.  This stuff is only going to get better, and certainly faster than my ability to learn anything the old way.</p>



<p>But I also do something else which gives me a privileged and unique insight into how the workforce will be using AI a decade from now. I run an after school code club in my local library for 8 to 13 year olds. I have witnessed first hand how this generation use AI to solve problems creatively.</p>



<p>There are so many stories of how awesome these children are.  For a flavour you can read <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/code-club-end-of-term-report-winter-2025/" data-type="post" data-id="2315">my end of term report</a>, or a <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/05/ai-and-summer-picnic/">recent diary entry</a> where a nine year old boy produced a stunningly creative app out of nowhere.</p>



<p>They are not learning coding the old way.  They would not be able to give you a very good explanation of a variable, loop, function, conditional or any other core programming concept.  Yet they can produce apps which do what is in their head. Creativity is allowed to flourish.</p>



<p>Now consider that by the time they leave school in 8-10 years, AI will be unrecognisable from what we have today.  They will be utilising AI in all manner of ways beyond coding.  If they enter the workforce in a KVM role (keyboard, video, mouse), entry level positions will require a pretty deep skill set to choreograph various AI agents.</p>



<p>One thing they won&#8217;t be doing is hand-wringing about whether there&#8217;s a difference between a junior and senior engineer.  AI is the new baseline and these children are catching that wave, and will surf unconcernedly whatever it washes over.</p>



<p>Too much discussion today centres on whether this or that model is better at A or B, or whether it lies or hallucinates, whether is only does basic things, whether it&#8217;s trained on stolen data and so on.</p>



<p>This misses the point. All those points will be mute in five years.</p>



<p>My friend Rob, from our school WhatsApp group, put it best when he said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--2">
<p>Here’s my big philosophical thought for the day. Circa 1985 the kids making the best stuff were those whose brains were capable of picking up a book on assembler and being able to navigate it. </p>



<p>2025 I think any kid can make stuff, since natural language is so democratizing, so maybe the kid with the biggest imagination wins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is what AI enables.  It unlocks imagination.</p>



<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s workforce are already doing that today.</p>
