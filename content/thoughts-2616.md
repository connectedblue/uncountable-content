<p>An important component of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/setting-investment-objectives/" data-type="post" data-id="1455">setting your investment objectives</a> is the selection of a suitable benchmark to measure your investment decisions against.</p>



<p>Suitable means a benchmark with some or all of the following characteristics:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>broadly reflects your investing strategy</li>



<li>doesn&#8217;t change over decades</li>



<li>includes 100% reinvestment of capital returned as dividend</li>



<li>reflects the cost of trading</li>



<li>is a &#8220;do nothing&#8221; option</li>
</ul>



<p>This rules out, for example, using a published index like the FTSE100.  This excludes returned dividends of around 3-4% a year so it will lag behind <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/" data-type="post" data-id="456">market performance</a> before you even start comparing to your portfolio performance.</p>



<p>The easiest way to pick a reliable benchmark with all these features is to select a specific, low cost, accumulating index fund in the market you mostly invest in.  Then all you need to do is take the price of those units between any two time periods, and compare it to your portfolio performance over the same period.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Buy your benchmark</h3>



<p>Rather than fiddling around with spreadsheets to check your portfolio against the benchmark, why not just buy it and use your investment platform to automatically track relative performance?</p>



<p>My benchmark is the <a href="https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B0CNH502-legal--general-uk-100-index-trust-i-acc/key-statistics">L&amp;G UK 100 Index I Acc</a>.  I have around 10% of my household portfolio invested in that fund, so I can see how the other 90% performs against that.</p>



<p>But you don&#8217;t have to commit such a chunk.  You could just buy £1,000 of the benchmark and leave it sitting there for the next few decades.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up the benchmark</h3>



<p>This depends on whether your investment platform allows you to edit the book value for every item in your portfolio (usually this records the purchase price so you can see the gain).  You&#8217;ll need to keep separate records of purchase and sale for CGT and other purposes.</p>



<p>On the day you decide to set everything up, set the book value to the market value for every holding, including the benchmark.  This means that every investment is showing a 0% return.</p>



<p>From that day forward, you&#8217;ll be able to see instantly how well your investment strategy is comparing against the benchmark, both at the individual holding level and the aggregate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adding new money</h3>



<p>If you move money between investments, then your platform should automatically change book for you.  So if you sell £10,000 of fund A and buy £5,000 of fund B and C, the correct amounts of book should be deducted from A and added to B and C.  This is nice because it takes account of the lag between the various trades due to trading windows and maybe your decision to time the market a bit.  </p>



<p>Adding new money needs a slightly different approach though because your running benchmark is relative to a fixed date in the past before that new money existed.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s quite simple though.  On the day the new money is invested, check the return on the benchmark.  Suppose that&#8217;s sitting at +31%.  Then all you do is adjust the book value for your new investment so that shows +31% too!</p>



<p>That might feel a bit weird at first &#8211; like you&#8217;re fiddling the system.  But it&#8217;s not at all really.  You&#8217;re just acting as if you had put that new money in on the day you set up the benchmark.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s suppose a month after the new money is added, the benchmark is now at +28% and your new investment is at +30%.  So there&#8217;s been a slump in the market.  However, your benchmark is working correctly!  You have beaten it by a whole 2 percentage points (even though you&#8217;ve notionally lost capital since your purchase).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits</h3>



<p>I last reset my portfolio benchmark in 2022 when I shifted <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/benchmarking-changes-to-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="2456">my strategy to 60:40 UK:US</a>. Everything got reset to zero in April 2022 for the ISA and September 2022 for the SIPP.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s extremely useful to see how that strategy has bed in (at the time of writing, the US side has outperformed the UK side by 7-11 percentage points).</p>



<p>In the end, only total return matters.  It&#8217;s hard to know whether a stock you bought in 2017 that&#8217;s gone up 34% and a fund you bought in 2023 that&#8217;s gone down 59% is better or worse than the &#8220;do nothing&#8221; approach of investing everything in a benchmark.</p>



<p>By setting up your book values correctly, you can tell at a glance every single day how your overall portfolio is performing relative to your benchmark.  </p>



<p>Being more engaged with your portfolio will result in better financial outcomes for you over the long term.</p>
