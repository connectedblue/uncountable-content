<p>Video calls happen on the following link, which is best accessed from a PC rather than phone:</p>



<p><a href="https://meet.jit.si/DamagingJudgementsMarketPolitely">Jitsi Video Bridge</a></p>



<p>No login is required to join the call, except if you are the organiser (see below).</p>



<p>There is also an option to dial in on the following:</p>



<p>Phone:  0203 885 2179<br>PIN:   3066 2380 95#</p>



<p>Please note, if you join by phone, your number is displayed to those who connect via the link.</p>



<p>See below if you have technical issues joining the call.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agenda</h3>



<p>If there are more than 4 people on the call, it helps to have an agenda.  The following framework will be used, unless the call organiser puts out an alternative:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Introductions from new people who&#8217;ve not been on the call before (10 mins)</li>



<li>Updates, thoughts, questions from anyone on the call (20 mins) </li>



<li>Specific call topic, identified in the meeting invite (30 mins)</li>
</ul>



<p>The organiser will time keep, and try to involve everyone in each part of the agenda.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Call protocols</h3>



<p>These calls are incredibly valuable, and a few simple tips help them run smoothly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>when you join, use your ii name and/or your first name in brackets.  It&#8217;s also helpful to indicate how many years since or to drawdown.  So +5 means in drawdown for five years, -3 means three years to go and 0 means within a year either way.</li>



<li>When you are not speaking, please go on mute.</li>



<li>To keep things flowing smoothly, use the &#8220;hand up&#8221; function in Jitsi if you want to add something to the conversation and the organiser will bring you in at an appropriate point.  If you are on the phone, shout during a suitable pause to let the organiser know and they will bring you in.</li>



<li>Video is entirely optional</li>



<li>Keep conversations to planning, methods, principles, experiences, markets, investment strategy, economy etc as they relate to drawdown and transition from accumulation.  </li>



<li>This is not a forum for discussion of investment picks, hot takes, political speculation or general musing about the unknowable future.  </li>



<li>Talk only about your own lived experience. Anecdotes from friends are not helpful because we don&#8217;t know them.  References to publicly available viewpoints are helpful though.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t divulge information about others outside the call</li>



<li>Allow the organiser to move the conversation on, bring others in and time keep.</li>



<li>Nothing in the call should be construed as financial advice.  If the organiser feels that the conversation is potentially going down that route, they will move the conversation on.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Follow ups</h3>



<p>After a call, it&#8217;s helpful to post additional thoughts in the Retirement Zoom Group.  These are distributed to group members, most of whom won&#8217;t be on the call but may be interested to see what was discussed.  </p>



<p>These aren&#8217;t viewable by the wider ii community, so it&#8217;s really about extending and clarifying spoken conversations and maintaining a context.</p>



<p>No-one is under any obligation to produce minutes for the call &#8211; you&#8217;re either on it, or you&#8217;re not!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technical issues joining</h3>



<p>The Jitsi platform is free, performant, functional, anonymous and no login is required.  That makes it ideal way to supplement the group posts in the app and be available to as many people as possible.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s not without issues and people have struggled to get their sound and microphones working on their devices.  The following tips may help:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The most reliable way is to join from a laptop.  If the mic and sound doesn&#8217;t work, you can fix on chrome as follows:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Goto the permissions menu next to the padlock in the browser bar</li>



<li>if camera and/or mic are shown as allowed, click the cross to clear them.</li>



<li>reload the page and after a few seconds, it should re-ask for permissions for both.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Sound doesn&#8217;t seem to work for Macs on either Chrome or Safari out of the box, unless you know how to fiddle with settings.</li>



<li>Joining from a phone by clicking the &#8220;join in browser&#8221; link, however note:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Android with Chrome should work fine </li>



<li>iPhones don&#8217;t work at all when joining from the browser. But you can download the app from the prompt on the screen after clicking the link. Permission settings are also required when installing the app.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In the app, you can manually type in the room name DamagingJudgementsMarketPolitely (it won&#8217;t let you copy and paste) and then permissions are asked for manually.  You can save this conversation so hopefully you won&#8217;t have to enter every time.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The iPad app works with no problems</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>There is a text chat feature in the app, so if you are in the room and think there&#8217;s a problem, drop a message in that.</li>
</ul>



<p>If anyone would like to test their device beforehand at any time, send a DM to <code>@uncountable</code> and we&#8217;ll arrange a 10 minute slot to test the connection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organising a call</h3>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t just have to be me organising the call. If anyone would like to lead on a topic or a regular day, feel free to put an invite post in the group and link back to this post for joining instructions:<br><br><a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/ii-retirement-zoom-group-video-call/">https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/ii-retirement-zoom-group-video-call/</a></p>



<p>On the day, you will need to join first with a login to allow other participants to get in.  The easiest way to do this is with a google account, but other options are available too.  </p>



<p>Once logged in, people can just join the call.  You will have some moderation options such as muting all.</p>
