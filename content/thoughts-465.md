<p>This post is in reply to <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/passion-1-art-by-kimberly/">Kimberly&#8217;s post on Passion art</a>.</p>



<p>This piece reminds me of concentrating on something so hard that you lose track of time.  There are many individual straight lines that appear curved when viewed together.</p>



<p>Passion is like making curves from straight lines. Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult for others to see anything other than a messy collection of lines. It takes a passionate person to point out the beauty of curves.</p>
