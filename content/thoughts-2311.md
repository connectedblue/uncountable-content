<p>I&#8217;ve been involved with <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/wildflower-meadow-restoration/" data-type="post" data-id="1387">wildflower meadow restoration</a> in the Cotswolds for six years.  There are many joyful aspects of this project, but the annual activity lifecycle provides structure to the year and a sense of renewal as each new season approaches.</p>



<p>The winter habitat management programme begins in late October and runs through to the end of March.  Here, we visit different sites in the area, some new and others returning favourites.  There&#8217;s usually around 10-12 of us and we undertake some aspect of manual restoration of the site.  This could involve grass cutting and raking, scrub removal, glade creation or creating light by reducing tree canopy.</p>



<p>Each site has different objectives, but the overall aim is to increase species rich grassland, which in turn leads to greater biodiversity on the site.  Sometimes we target specific species like rare fly orchids, or the Duke of Burgundy butterfly.  At the end of every work party, there&#8217;s great satisfaction at seeing the changes made, ready for the new season of growth.</p>



<p>After the winter programme is over, the survey season starts in May, June and July where baseline botanical surveys are conducted for sites which allow them to be graded for how species rich they are.  This feeds into grant applications for stewardship and other incentive programmes that encourage environmental land management.</p>



<p>The survey methodology involves making 10 quadrats on the site.  Each quadrat is one meter square and the number of grass and herb species are identified.  This is a great way to improve identification skills and also spend a pleasant warm day in a beautiful meadow.</p>



<p>As summer rolls in, the main event begins in July.  The seed harvesting season begins.  We visit existing mature, species-rich grasslands and collect the seed with a brush harvesting process.  It&#8217;s pretty simple &#8211; a landrover pulls the motorised harvester with a revolving brush around the meadow.  The seeds are collected into a hopper and dried on a tarpaulin in the sun.</p>



<p>It can only take place on dry days, and in a good season we may collect around 3,000kg.  This is an awful lot of seed and will be used for the final activity in the year &#8211; seed spreading.</p>



<p>Landowners who wish to create new meadow will usually have their land over-seeded in September or October.  This allows the seed to benefit from the winter frost and give them a chance to germinate the following spring.  There are a few techniques for this.  Larger sites involve sitting on the back of a truck and throwing it out the back, and smaller sites can be done with a line of people with seeds in a bucket.</p>



<p>Either way, the aim is to target areas of bare earth to give it the maximum chance of success.  A haul of 3,000kg is enough to seed 120ha of new meadow.</p>



<p>And then, the next winter habitat season rolls round once again, and the cycle continues. Land is renewed and well being is renewed.</p>
