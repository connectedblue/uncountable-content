<p>Just cancelled my monthly spotify subscription which I&#8217;ve been paying since 2010.  I don&#8217;t really use the service enough, or care enough about specific music.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll use this opportunity to explore IndieWeb music sources, so <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/contact-me/" data-type="post" data-id="218">contact me</a> if you know any.</p>
