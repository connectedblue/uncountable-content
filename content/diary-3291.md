<p>I took a trip up to the council offices at Ebley Mill to hear presentations from Stroud High year 10 and 12 students on their projects to study the health of the river Frome.</p>



<p>It was an incredibly uplifting day.  The students were extremely knowledgable, articulate and had put of lot of work into the project and write up.  Many are also aspiring ecologists and conservationists, and this exercise was a fabulous chance to achieve their <a href="https://www.crestawards.org/crest-star">CREST awards</a>  and recognition.</p>



<p>They were understandably nervous beforehand about doing a presentation in the council chambers in front of a load of adults they didn&#8217;t know.  But they really were terrific, and if they had nerves, they weren&#8217;t on show.  They projected their voices  clearly and confidently, and their points were easy to follow.</p>



<p>Afterwards, we got a chance to give feedback and ask questions.  I tried to make my question fairly low ball, but some of the others fired complex issues for their thoughts.  But they handled all with ease.</p>



<p>The environment faces unprecedented challenges over the next 40 years, but fortunately we have smart, passionate people to solve them.</p>



<p>We are in safe hands.</p>
