<p>Another very warm afternoon when I met up with Kathy at 2pm for another session of grid square surveying of the SSSI.  We were joined by a couple of members of the Wildflower Society from Chipping Sodbury.  Kathy is holding an event for them soon, and today was a recce and risk assessment from the organisers.</p>



<p>We picked a mix of areas that were mown and unmown the previous winter.  They didn&#8217;t seem quite as species rich as <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/05/surveying-stinchcombes-slopes/" data-type="post" data-id="6006">other areas</a> we did in the last few weeks, but still some nice specimens.</p>



<p>We bumped into David who was up there counting visitors for future funding applications, so we were pleased to bump up his numbers.  It was pretty hot by late afternoon, so after about 6 squares, we called it a day at 4pm.</p>
