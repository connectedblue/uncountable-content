<p>I like daily puzzles.  For the last few years, my morning routine has consisted of doing wordle, quordle and waffle before anything else.  They are not terribly hard, and I can usually complete all three within 15 minutes.</p>



<p>Imagine my excitement when I stumbled upon <a href="https://thinkygames.com/dailies/">Thinky Dailies</a>.  It&#8217;s a new puzzle every day, but with a much greater variety of game types and difficulty.  And they are created with the most beautiful artwork and narrative around each one.</p>



<p>Season One was launched on 30 November 2025, so as of this post I&#8217;m still catching up.  I&#8217;ve done 34 of the puzzles, taking me up to January 2, so I still have another 24 to catch up before I can add the daily thinky to my existing routine.</p>



<p>They really vary in difficulty &#8211; some are solved in less than a minute and some have been an hour. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s free to sign up, but you have to solve a riddle first to join the wait list (if you share the link, you get released from the wait list immediately).  The preview riddle is pretty easy, but it puts you in the mindset for solving the dailies.</p>



<p>If you like daily puzzles, I definitely recommend giving this one a try.  You can <a href="https://thinkygames.com/dailies/">sign up here</a>.</p>
