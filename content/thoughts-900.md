<p>I do reasonably often reply to posts by other writers.  In fact it was while I was doing this that I stumbled on the <a href="https://birming.com/july-reply-blog/">July Reply</a> challenge by Robert Birming.</p>



<p>I really like his suggestion of using Re: in the title.  It&#8217;s genius really &#8211; everyone instantly recognises a context when they see those three characters at the beginning of a subject line.  It also avoids polluting my own url namespace &#8211; having all the slugs begin with <code>re-</code> means I can re-use those titles if I want to create a post of my own with a similar topic.</p>



<p>So, on this page for the month of July, I will list all my reply posts below as my contribution to the challenge.</p>
