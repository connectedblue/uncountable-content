<p>The grasslands at the top of Rodborough are always worth a special trip at this time of year.  There are so many species .... fragrant orchid, common milkwort, early purple orchid, green-winged orchid, common rock-rose, yellow wort and common spotted orchid.  That was just in a small section without really looking too hard.</p>



<p>But the immediate thing that strikes you looking down the south west facing grass slopes is the abundance of yellow rattle.  Literally tens of thousands of plants tumbling down. </p>



<p>I completed a three mile circuit around the common, and it was the same wherever you look.  The weather was stunning, and it&#8217;s hard to think of a more beautiful part of the world to live.</p>
