<p>The journey up to Liverpool was a long one from Epsom.  We arrived in the dark outside the red brick building where my paternal Nanna had just moved in to a new flat.  The living room ceilings were impossibly high, and every available surface was taken with either a photo or china.</p>



<p>The wireless was wooden, with a fabric speaker and dials to change the station.  The throaty sound of Radio Merseyside filled the room during the day.  At night it was replaced by the picture of a colour TV.</p>



<p>At school, we did a play in the classroom.  I had a leading part, and at one point in the play, I had to pretend to climb down a ladder and there was a ghost at the bottom.  Each time it made me jump, even though I knew it was coming.</p>
