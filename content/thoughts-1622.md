<p>Lou and JeddaCP have pulled together an <a href="https://blogroll.club/">excellent directory of blogs and personal websites</a> where you can search for new sources of content to read.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think you can ever have too many of these directories around the independent web. They are an integral part of the social and discovery connection hubs needed if you wish to experience digital life outside of the social media giants. </p>



<p>They are part of the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/human-protocols/" data-type="post" data-id="497">human protocol infrastructure</a> which, in my view, are more important than the technical protocols that aim to do the same thing.</p>



<p>They have notched up the directory experience one more level though with two additional features which make it very easy to add new blogs to your RSS reader:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://blogroll.club/an-rss-feed-for-all-the-blogs-in-a-blog-directory/">single RSS feed</a> which contains the latest published articles from all blogs.  Just add one RSS link in the instructions on that page and you&#8217;re good to go &#8211; a diverse mix of posts popping automatically into your reader every day.</li>



<li>There is a seperate <a href="https://blogroll.club/feed/">new blog RSS feed</a> which notes the individual additions so you can add them separately if required.</li>
</ul>



<p>This makes it very easy to get started by just reading new stuff when it&#8217;s available. If you want to be more precise though, there&#8217;s also an alphabetical list and categorized collections.</p>



<p>I get quite quite a few daily visitors to my own blog which are referred by this site, so I appreciate the effort by Lou and Jedda to make the independent web an easier place to traverse.</p>



<p>If you have a website, you can easily request your own to be added via a simple form on the site.</p>
