<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member Geezer J, who built up a substantial property portfolio to fund retirement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>I was brought up in a family with lots of love but few material possessions. The mantra of ‘looking after the pennies’ was drilled into me constantly. </p>



<p>I graduated with a mediocre finance/accountancy degree but knew immediately that I didn’t want to be an accountant. I changed jobs frequently before eventually becoming a building society manager, mortgage broker, estate agent and then finally a bookkeeper/financial controller for that estate agent. </p>



<p>I started a small pension in my early 20’s. I’ve always been careful not to spend money I didn’t possess. However, between 30 and 50, getting married and bringing up two children seemed to cloud my judgement.  The pension was stopped and life just involved spending everything we earned. Lots of exotic holidays, cars, restaurants etc. </p>



<p>It was only after this period that I realised I was 50+ and had no foundation in place for my later life. Divorce made me realise the price I had paid for taking my eye off the ball over the preceding 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is one thing you wished you had done during your 30s to 50s?</h3>



<p>For the relatively small amount involved I should have continued paying into my personal pension and not stopped the payments on the grounds of ‘I can’t afford this’. </p>



<p>In fact, I should have upped the payments every few years. However, if my pot had been larger I’d assume my ex-wife would have taken half the pension. Maybe on reflection it was a wise decision! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>I started investing by accident, just before my divorce. I purchased a buy to let (B2L) in 2006 and realised it was a really good way of adding to my income for little extra work. At the time I was a mortgage broker and chose to manage the property myself. </p>



<p>Initially I made a few mistakes with bad tenants but soon learnt what to look for &#8211;  a formula that paid massive dividends over the next 15+ years. Since meeting my new partner in 2011 we have gradually expanded the portfolio to 5 B2L properties. In 2022 at 62 years old we retired and now live off this rental income alone. </p>



<p>Along the way we started and accumulated decent SIPPs and ISAs (all invested in global equity index funds), which will make us very comfortable, especially when we receive our state pensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am a complete believer that diversification should not just involve worldwide index funds, as that leaves you wide open to potential market corrections that could ruin the best laid plans. </p>



<p>I think property (not your own home) is the best way of doing that. Lots of people seem concerned about changing legislation in the B2L market but I see that as a good thing. Tenants do need protecting from bad landlords, and vice versa for bad tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are your properties inside a limited company, and when would mortgages be cleared?</h3>



<p>Unfortunately not. The first four properties were purchased before buying through limited companies became popular. </p>



<p>The cost of switching over is much too prohibitive as it involves effectively selling and re-buying from yourself. If I was starting again now I’d definitely buy them that way.</p>



<p>All the mortgages are interest only at approx 60% loan to value. I have no intention of clearing any of them but do intend to lower that LTV to around 40% over time. </p>



<p>If I lowered them further I’d incur HRT plus more of my estate would be subject to IHT. I’m happy that a 40% LTV will protect me against any market corrections as and when remortgaging comes around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>My goals now are to keep the B2L properties long term, eventually leaving them to my children. Yes they’ll incur IHT but at least CGT will be avoided (unless the rules change). </p>



<p>With the rest of my estate, (assuming the pension double taxation rules come into force and it&#8217;s impossible to leave any of my SIPP IHT free) my intention is to follow Bill Perkins’s great book and ‘Die with Zero’. </p>



<p>I’ve already helped my kids buy their homes and will now help them pay off their mortgages too. Personally, we’ll be taking lots of holidays/cruises, fulfilling as many dreams as we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As previously mentioned I retired from work in 2022 but still manage my 5 B2L properties. I expect to continue that for many years yet but will eventually hand that over to my son. Unlike most doubters, who say managing properties is a big, stressful job, I can honestly say it takes me about 40 hours per annum to keep the portfolio under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have just moved into drawdown with my SIPP, largely because of the budget changes. I think it’s best to get the funds out of the SIPP now so will withdraw up to the HRT limit each year. It’ll either be spent, gifted to the kids or invested into ISA’s.</p>



<p>The accumulation stage was mainly between 2010 and 2022. Although I had the small personal pension pot from the 1980’s plus a SERPS pot most funds have gone in since 2010. Around 50% of my annual income was invested each year during that period.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Will you be growing the property portfolio during retirement?</h3>



<p>We have no intention to grow the portfolio further during retirement. Five is enough to provide a great level of income to support our personal and state pensions. </p>



<p>Now is the time to spend, not invest further. Also, at the moment, I believe the costs of purchasing to be prohibitive for new B2L’s. </p>



<p>The level of stamp duty is a major barrier, especially as I expect property prices to grow much slower over the next 20 years. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>I have devised and adapted my own spreadsheet system over many years that covers everything we earn, spend and invest. It projects forward to age 100. </p>



<p>I use very conservative growth rates on the investments and 2.5% for inflation. As a result I know exactly what we can spend each year. </p>



<p>To allow for market movements on the invested element I keep 3 years of potential withdrawals in money market funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you the main person in your household who looks after the finances?</h3>



<p>Yes I am the main person but my partner is very competent too. She is aware of everything I do and could do most things in my absence. </p>



<p>I am, however, the driver behind the B2L’s, so I think she would consider selling them off if I wasn’t around. I am training my son with a view to managing them should that happen, as I fear the potential CGT bill would make that a bad decision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>I would describe my investing style as cautiously risky and well diversified. As explained earlier I believe the property element of my portfolio gives me an extra layer of diversification. </p>



<p>Apart from the money market funds all my SIPP and ISA money is in global index funds. I see little point in complicating things with bonds. </p>



<p>Even at 62 years old I consider most of my money will be invested long term so history shows equities is the place for that money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You clearly fall into the category of professional, rather than accidental landlord.&nbsp; What tips would you pass to others who are thinking of diversifying in this direction?</h3>



<p>I may be a professional landlord now but when I first started I had no knowledge at all.</p>



<p>My tips would be: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>buy using a limited company.</li>



<li>buy fairly new (over 5 years but under 20 years) houses (not flats).</li>



<li>low maintenance in terms of exterior &amp; garden size.</li>



<li>3 or 4 bedroom so that tenants will have children.</li>



<li>choose tenants with children that will attend local schools.</li>



<li>as long as the tenants work, accept housing benefit. </li>



<li>Review rent annually &amp; keep it at a level just below the market rate.</li>



<li>Don’t fall into the trap of failing to increase the rent for a long period (it&#8217;s a business).</li>
</ul>



<p>If the above criteria are met your tenants should treat the property as their own home and stay a long time. </p>



<p>We’ve only lost two tenants in the last 12 years. As long as the property is reasonably tidy and not damaged on annual inspection I leave the tenants alone. </p>



<p>I speak to them twice a year to ask if everything is OK or if any work needs doing that they haven’t reported as urgent. It&#8217;s in my interest to keep the properties in good condition. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>All my education was gathered over years in the finance industry. I read no specific magazines, just ad hoc things as they come along. I follow Pete Matthew, James Shack and Damian Jordan on ‘You Tube’. I find their content excellent for novices and very reassuring for myself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>We are all very different people with unique journeys. I find it fascinating seeing how we’ve all got to where we are now. It amazes me how many of us reach a similar destination, albeit often via very different routes.</p>
