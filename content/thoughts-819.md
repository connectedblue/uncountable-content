<p>In response to devon.lol who has just <a href="https://devon.lol/blog/implementing-webmentions-is-a-pain/">implemented webmentions</a> on their site and noted what a pain it is:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--9">
<p>We lost the web to Facebook, Twitter, and the rest because making things on the web was hard and they came in giving people an easy on-ramp. Now here we are in 2024 trying to take it back, and our answer is that, if you want to interact with other web sites, just complete these 13 simple steps, sign up for multiple services, integrate with APIs, build a UI… what are we doing here?</p>

<p>This may be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that webmention won&#8217;t go mainstream until it is implemented in wordpress core by default.  Then the simple act of linking to another site will generate webmention action without the users having to think at all (and if they don&#8217;t like it, they can switch it off).</p>



<p>Whatever we think of wordpress as a tech stack, it has single-handedly kept the IndieWeb alive.  I would estimate that over 90% of the 300+ feeds in my RSS just have the <code>/feed</code> appended to the url.  So they are either wordpress, or backwards compatible to its conventions.</p>



<p>This blog has webmention implemented with a wordpress plugin, which was largely ok, although I did file a bug report on the github.  This is yet another reason why I am locked to wordpress.</p>



<p>I do actually possess the technical skills, motivation and curiosity to migrate my front end to another stack, but in the end, content creation and standards are way more important.  I&#8217;d rather spend time writing posts and reading RSS than figuring out how to roll my own web infrastructure.</p>



<p>I love and loathe wordpress in equal measure, which I believe is the only pragmatic attitude at this stage of the digital era.  Despite it&#8217;s flaws, there is no other game in town that comes close for ordinary people to create content online, outside of the social media giants. </p>
