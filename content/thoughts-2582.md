<p>Do you ever wish you could go back and just have a Take Two?  Just redo the the whole thing differently and work to a new outcome?</p>



<p>I feel like I&#8217;m on Take Two of my fifties, with the Take One being the continuation of my forties which didn&#8217;t actually happen.</p>



<p>In August 2019, a couple of months before my 51st birthday, I walked home from work <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/stopping-work/" data-type="post" data-id="575">for the last time</a>.  After 29 years of continuous employment, I had a sense that I wanted to traverse my fifties on my own terms.</p>



<p>It would have been pretty easy to just carry on with Take One to be honest. I had a pretty good job, a wide network of contacts and plenty of opportunities to do new things. No-one would have batted an eyelid if I&#8217;d have carried on working until 60.</p>



<p>Take Two, of course, didn&#8217;t get off to the greatest of starts.  Six months in, a little thing called covid came along, and the next month my investment portfolio dropped 32%.</p>



<p>But, after emerging from lockdown, I was more determined than ever to carry on with Take Two. I had started to get interested in nature recovery amd 5-6 projects took me all over the Cotswolds. In my local community, I got involved with organised the annual walking festival and other related events. While online, <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">the Artocalypse</a> &#8211; an art community I co-founded during lockdown, continued to thrive.</p>



<p>I slowly began to find <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">structure, purpose and identity</a> for this Take Two and rather liked it.  It felt 10x better than Take One would have been, and that was mainly because I was now <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocating time</a> exactly as I choose.</p>



<p>2023 was a pivotal year.  I began to <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">keep a diary</a>, mainly to keep track of all the various things I was doing.  And I also started running the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>, which still remains my favourite part of the week.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/five-years/" data-type="post" data-id="1246">five years</a> passes and I feel that there&#8217;s now no going back. I&#8217;m firmly on Take Two, and Take One is never going to return.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t looked back since.</p>
