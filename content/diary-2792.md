<p>When I woke up, there was a present at the end of my bed.  I didn&#8217;t really know why.  It was a Dougal puppet from the magic roundabout.  I woke up Katy in the bed next to me who also had one.  Hers was Brian (the snail).</p>



<p>My paternal nanna opened the door.  She said that mummy was coming home later that day.</p>



<p>Later on, we went downstairs and everyone was in the living room.  My mum was holding a bundle and I went up to take a look.  There was a baby in it.</p>



<p>This was the house in Burrows Close, Bookham.</p>
