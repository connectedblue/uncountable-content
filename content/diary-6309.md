<p>Had to delay this month&#8217;s check by a week, so met with Graham early to take a look at our regular site by the ocean.</p>



<p>We were very mindful of the fact that there&#8217;s been hardly any rain, so we were expecting pretty low water levels.  We have no idea how that might affect the habitat for riverfly when the water is so shallow.</p>



<p>It turned out we had pretty low counts, but we managed to find at least one for four different species so we didn&#8217;t trigger.  One very noticeable thing was the lack of grit in the sample ... it was much more silty that usual.</p>



<p>There was also an unusual find of what we initially thought were cased caddis, but were in cases made of bark and leaf matter, rather than stones.  They also had long antennae, which cased caddis don&#8217;t normally have.  So we put this out onto the WhatsApp group to see if anyone else had an idea what they could be. </p>
