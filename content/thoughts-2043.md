<p>Louie has a perspective on the <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/range.html">range reach of posts</a> in the new fact checking era that humanity has embarked upon this week:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--11">
<p>Content moderation is a much bigger issue for platforms than it is for independent, decentralized websites. Without those features mentioned above, posts have&nbsp;<a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/making-time.html">limited range</a>&nbsp;and have a hard time gaining traction.&nbsp;<strong>Surfacing those posts</strong>&nbsp;by functioning as a platform is what enables potential harm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the heart of the matter, which I also refer to as distribution in <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/fact-checking-not-important/" data-type="post" data-id="2008">my thoughts on the subject</a> earlier this week. Platforms have created a smoke screen of &#8220;fact checking&#8221; as something that is the user&#8217;s responsibility.</p>



<p>Previously their internal content moderation teams were deciding which pieces of content shouldn&#8217;t be promoted to hundreds of millions of people.  These decisions were based on policies shaped by advertisers, regulators and shareholder interests.</p>



<p>Now this has been dismantled, it allows complete freedom to distribute any piece of content to suit the purpose of the platform&#8217;s backers. Meta and X claim that the community is doing the moderation, but they have not outlined how the result of that &#8220;moderation&#8221; feeds back into the distribution algorithm.</p>



<p>My guess is that is won&#8217;t.  They&#8217;ll distribute whatever they choose, to whomever they choose, for whatever purpose they choose.</p>



<p>Louie goes on to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--12">
<p>Whenever I beat the RSS drum, someone always asks about discoverability, so I want to put this bluntly: it is through algorithmic discoverability features that harmful posts become visible. Whether they are original posts, reposts, or replies, harmful posts are only able to successfully reach their intended audience by depending on those features functioning as social media websites built them.</p>



<p>It&nbsp;<strong>should</strong>&nbsp;be a little hard for any post to gain traction. That’s a necessary filter to reduce your exposure to things that will deeply upset you and derail your day.</p>



<p>Maybe we should build social networking around blogs and RSS feeds.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes, we absolutely should!</p>



<p>I will continue to post under my own domain right up until a gun is pointed at my head saying independent websites are not allowed.  And I will continue to get my feed of information through RSS, compiled from a list of sources I have chosen.</p>



<p>Yes it&#8217;s hard.  It&#8217;s hard to write a blog, and it&#8217;s hard to get RSS working (but those of us with blogs <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1174">do all we can to try and make it easier</a> for others to get started).</p>



<p>I actually don&#8217;t agree with Louie that there is a lack of RSS writing software.  WordPress has done more for RSS that anyone.  I would say the majority of blog writers don&#8217;t even realise they also have a feed!  But of course, there is still room for more innovation.</p>



<p>Louie has inspired me to take some action!  One of the hardest things to explain to any new RSS user is how to get feeds.  Saying try adding &#8220;/feed&#8221; or &#8220;/rss&#8221; or &#8220;/rss.xml&#8221; to the URL just doesn&#8217;t cut it.  Nor does it help when they see a weird bunch of xml code on the browser screen, and you say &#8220;yeah, that&#8217;s it &#8211; copy that url and put it in the reader&#8221;</p>



<p>So, what I&#8217;m going to start doing is a series of posts called &#8220;links for your RSS reader&#8221; where I just lay out the full thing to copy, alongside a description of what can be found there.</p>



<p>If we can make it easier for people to participate in the independent web, then they will.</p>
