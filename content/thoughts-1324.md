<p>I&#8217;ve got posts on this blog which are for RSS subscribers only.  Now I&#8217;ve made them completely invisible to web users.  Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/elevate-your-websites-rss-feed/" data-type="post" data-id="1061">example of what happens if you try to access one</a>  from the web.  </p>



<p>The entire collection of all my RSS posts are <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/rss-only/">collected together here</a>. Nope, you can&#8217;t see them from the web either.  But &#8230; you can subscribe to that collection by entering <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/rss-only/feed/">https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/rss-only/feed/</a> into your feed reader (subscribing to my main feed will also receive the new ones &#8211; one coming up this Saturday).</p>
