<p>We have launched the submission window for the latest Artocalypse community art project:  the <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2025-ember-and-ink/">2025 Ember &amp; Ink Poetry Expo</a>.</p>



<p>During April and May we are providing an opportunity for poets to have their work published online, alongside others, in a celebration of poetry.  This can be an existing work or something composed specially for the expo.</p>



<p>If you have a website, you can also claim one year&#8217;s free membership of the Artocalypse artist community.  Join other independent web artists for in a private server, and also have your website RSS feed added to the <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">artocalypse.org home page</a>.  Every time you publish a post, it&#8217;ll automatically show up in in our art stream.</p>



<p>A big, big thank you to the fabulous organisers, <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/">Kimberly</a> and <a href="https://heatherandbone.com/">Heather</a>.  They are not only innovative artists, but also care passionately about creating positive and collaborative spaces for artists to thrive online.  If you submit a piece, you can hang out with them and others in our community.  You&#8217;ll find like-minded people and endless inspiration.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve held quite a few expos over the last five years, in various places online.  Our approach is to let the art do the talking, and present work in the most beautiful way we can.  Check out our <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2024-artocalypse-end-of-year-artist-feature/">previous expo here</a>, and leave a comment in the visitor book if you like it!   </p>



<p>So if you&#8217;d like to take part, we&#8217;d love to hear from you.  Or if you have a friend who writes poems, share this with them.</p>



<p>Be part of an online celebration of poetry!</p>
