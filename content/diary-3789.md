<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Headed off down to Arrow town today.  Set off at around 9am because we wanted to see a lot of things on the Haast pass.  This road was only created for cars in 1960 and was only finally fully sealed in 1995.  This road is a key link between the south and the west coast.</p>
<p>There are lots of places to stop on the road &#8211; we saw the blue pools, fantail falls and some bush walks.  The scenery is as stunning as in the rest of the south island.</p>
<p>Booked a trip to Milford Sound for the 22 January.</p>
<p>Arrived in Arrowtown at around 4.30pm which was a good time to walk around the town before things closed.  The cottage here is fantastic &#8211; a luxury one compared to the last one we were in.  Went out to a local restaurant called Stables for dinner.</div>
