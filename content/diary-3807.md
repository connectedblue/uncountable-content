<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Headed out to McLaren Falls in the morning, a nice bush park about 10 miles south of Tauranga.  Walked around a number of trails in the park.  Some went by the river, and some climbed high onto a ridge.  A bit overcast this morning, but good weather for walking.  Had lunch in a nice picnic spot above the park.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we headed off to the mount at Maunegaga (next to Taurganga).  It was full of holidaymakers as it is still a bank holiday in New Zealand.  There is a huge sandy beach and a port with a couple of huge cruise liners docked.</p>
<p>We climbed the mount, around 270 meters.  Going up was pretty easy (even though it was very hot).  Coming back down on the other side, we went a very steep way &#8211; the steps were almost vertical.  Once reraching the bottom it was a pleasant walk around the mount to en up back in town again.</div>
