<p>Lou wrote a fascinating <a href="https://louplummer.lol/time-is-what-you-make-of-it/">insight into how he adjusted to life after work</a>. I suspect this happens quite often:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--29">
<p>During the couple of years that I tried to be retired, I had more free time than I&#8217;d ever had before. With no job to go to and a wife who was still heading to work each day, I had hours to do what I wanted, except I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted. I read some books from the library, watched a few movies from my streaming queues, and went for walks on occasion. However, I lacked a sense of purpose. I ended up sleeping a lot, feeling sad and lonely. It was not a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>I stopped work five years ago and found that certain <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">benefits from work</a> need to be replaced to help with the transition.  Specifically: structure, purpose and identity were the things I worked on.</p>



<p>Reading through Lou&#8217;s post, you can see how he went about this in a way that worked for him.  The ability to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocate time</a> as you wish is such an amazing privilege and experience, but you can&#8217;t really plan it in advance.</p>



<p>Sure, you may think you are going to travel, play golf, visit family or whatever.  And if that&#8217;s motivates you to save more and retire sooner, even better.</p>



<p>But be prepared for life to deal a different hand.  There are so many opportunities out there that you are simply not aware of when your head is in work day to day.</p>



<p>My day to day activities are <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">logged in my diary</a>.  I truly never would have imagined any of them ten years ago.</p>
