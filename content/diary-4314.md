<p>It&#8217;s been months in planning, but today was finally the day for the first trip for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> to visit the facilities of the <a href="https://gloslibraries.uk/lab">Innovation Lab</a> at Stroud Library.  Eleven members of the club met promptly at 10am in Dursley library, excited to start the day.</p>



<p>I gave them a briefing for the day, issued hiviz jackets and we made our way to the waiting coach in the bus station next door.  Half an hour later, we were in the lab and Lewis, the lab technician, was giving an introduction to the equipment and activities we had laid on.</p>

<p>They were divided into four groups of three and rotated around every 20-25 minutes so everyone got a good chance to have a go at everything.</p>

<p>Just before lunch, we did a tour of the library and had a look at the science, coding and other books available.  This turned out to be very popular, and every child came away with an armful of books borrowed on their library card.  Some hadn&#8217;t borrowed books before, and learned how to use the machine to check out.  And they liked the fact that they can borrow from Stroud and take back in Dursley.</p>



<p>We went back to the meeting room for lunch and talked about the morning activities.  At the end of lunch, there was a lot of reading going on before the afternoon activities.  So the library tour was really successful and I need to think about how to incorporate books more into the regular code clubs.</p>



<p>We had another hour after lunch to finish the activities.  Every child had a 2D cut keyring with their name they designed and we finished up with Lewis demonstrating how the 3D printing works.  That will obviously take a while to print out, so their final models will be sent through the internal post in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>We finished up on time and the coach was waiting to take us back to Dursley.  We arrived back earlier than expected so there was an impromptu code club session on the library computers while waiting for parent pick up.</p>



<p>A very successful day, and well worth all the planning.  Every child was engaged and inspired in the digital creation activities and hopefully encourages them to continue to be curious about coding.</p>
