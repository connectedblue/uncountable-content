<p>Given the importance of <a href="/teaching-sand-to-add">teaching sand to add up</a>, it&#8217;s quite remarkable how we pretty much devolved the task to just one company.</p>



<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) fabricate 62% of the worlds chips.  The next largest is Samsung with around 11%.  But it&#8217;s even more stark when you consider the advanced chips.  TSMC have around 80% share of the 5nm technology and over 90% of 3nm.</p>



<p>A modern car may have as many as 3,000 chips inside it (which itself is mind boggling &#8211; does anyone really know what they all do?).  So I think it&#8217;s safe to say that TSMC is the most important company in the world.</p>



<p>But hang on &#8230;.</p>



<p>TSMC don&#8217;t just magic chips out of thin air.  They make them with machines.  Those machines seem pretty important.  Who makes those?</p>



<p>Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) are a Dutch company that make incredible machines that can etch computer logic onto molecules of sand. Who knew that the land of tulips and clogs would be producing such wizardry?</p>



<p>They have some competitors, but ASML produce 83% of the world&#8217;s chip making machines.  No-one even comes close, and they keep their know-how very close to their chest.  So I think it&#8217;s safe to say that ASML is the most important company in the world.</p>



<p>But hang on &#8230;</p>



<p>Lithography means reflecting lasers off mirrors right? To target those molecules of sand precisely, you can&#8217;t just use the wing mirror from your car. You need a really flat mirror. Who on earth makes those?</p>



<p>Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS) makes flat mirrors in Germany.  Like really, really flat ones.</p>



<p>If you took a ZEISS mirror and scaled it up to be the size of Germany, the tallest peak on the surface would be 1mm.   You could shine a laser onto a ZEISS mirror and target a golf ball on the moon.</p>



<p>Literally no-one else knows how to do that.</p>



<p>Without ZEISS, ASML would be hawking miniature windmills to tourists along the canals of Amsterdam.</p>



<p>So I think it&#8217;s safe to say that ZEISS is the most important company in the world.</p>
