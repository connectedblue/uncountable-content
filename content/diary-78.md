<p>My ideal calendar strategy is that each day should have either zero or one thing scheduled.  The last few were unusual because of evening events.</p>



<p>But today my one thing was to meet a friend for lunch at the <a href="https://theraggedcot-minchinhampton.com/">Ragged Cot</a> in Minchinhampton.  We went to school together in Surrey, but somehow managed to end up in neighbouring villages in Gloucestershire.</p>



<p>Nice venue and food, although it&#8217;s tough to see so few customers mid week.  So hard to run a restaurant business at the moment.</p>
