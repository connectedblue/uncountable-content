<p>Affirmations are short, repeatable statements to help you think more positively about your life and purpose in this world.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t practice them in this sense, however I do have a number of rituals which help me understand my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">structure, purpose and identity</a> since stopping work in 2019, aged 51.  This was probably the single biggest transition I have undertaken in my life, and it took a good couple of years to nail down.</p>



<p>The first, and most important, ritual is to keep <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">an online diary</a> of all the activities I do.  There isn&#8217;t an entry every day, but only when something significant happens.  I&#8217;ve been keeping it since 2023, and it helps immensely to make sense of the projects that I choose to allocate time to.</p>



<p>The second ritual feels more like an affirmation because it sets a framework for the next few months ahead.  I publish a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/now/" data-type="post" data-id="2026">Now page</a> which summarises the ongoing and new commitments I have to community and conservation projects.  If they weren&#8217;t written down, they would just languish and pass by.  Reviewing this page regularly helps to make sure progress is made on all fronts.</p>



<p>The third ritual is more of a cleansing.  I discovered the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/winter-solstice-2024-volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/" data-type="post" data-id="1907">Volunteer Amnesty Day</a> which takes place on the longest and shortest day each year.  The idea is to review what and how you give volunteer time and to drop things where necessary.  This prevents burnout, and allows you space to step back without feeling guilty (the core idea being that if your contribution is important, someone else will step up.  If it&#8217;s not, then is it worth your continued commitment?).</p>



<p>So while these things don&#8217;t fall into the traditional definition of affirmations, I find them very useful.  It&#8217;s important to be intentional about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/how-i-allocate-time/" data-type="post" data-id="1688">how you allocate time</a> after stopping work.  Time is the most valuable asset we have, and it relentlessly depreciates before our eyes.</p>
