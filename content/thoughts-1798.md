<p>Since stopping work, my strategy has been to hold four years of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">non discretionary spend</a> in cash. This allows me to sleep at night, and not worry about the day to day volatility of the stock market.</p>



<p>Some might view this as excessive (although annual non discretionary spend is much smaller than you might think), but I don&#8217;t hold bonds or other assets.  </p>



<p>Holding this amount of cash also allows me to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/layering-your-cash-accounts/" data-type="post" data-id="783">layer it into four components</a> so I can put my hands on cash for foreseeable needs.  I have also dipped into it for large discretionary purchases (such as a car).  Again, this means I don&#8217;t have to put off purchases if the market happens to be down at the moment.</p>



<p>In short, having access to sufficient cash during draw down allows me to significantly reduce the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-risk/" data-type="post" data-id="663">risk of not being able to put my hands on money</a> when I need to in the short term.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Topping up</h3>



<p>I do a quarterly review of my overall portfolio, and a key part is looking at the current cash position to decide if I want to top up or not. So although the aim is to keep four years of spend, the actual multiple will vary on how I feel and what might be coming up. I have been as low as 1.7x in the past, particularly after a big purchase, but usually I like to be at least above 2.8.</p>



<p>I never want to go below 1x &#8211; that would be a red line for me and regardless of what the market was doing, I&#8217;d make an immediate full or partial top up.</p>



<p>Depending on how the market is doing, I&#8217;ll either top up the full amount back up to 4x, or if it&#8217;s looking a bit slumpy I might go for a smaller amount.  This just consists of selling an appropriate amount of units from an index fund.</p>



<p>At the moment, i&#8217;m selling FTSE100 units, which will cause my S&amp;P holdings to tick up as a percentage of allocation.  Of course, that may alter in the future if my portfolio strategy should change.</p>



<p>The other thing to note is that my target of four years happens to be applicable now.  I&#8217;m in my mid fifties at time of writing, and I don&#8217;t have any information that leads me to conclude I need to hold a buffer bigger than four years.  However, that may change in future.  If I&#8217;m lucky enough to make it to mid eighties, maybe I&#8217;ll feel more comfortable by holding ten years of cash.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cash inside SIPPs</h3>



<p>I started to draw down in 2019, aged 51.  When I stopped work, I had ample cash for the target, and didn&#8217;t need to do the first top up until 2021.  </p>



<p>However, since reaching 55, I&#8217;m able to access SIPP funds as well for cash withdrawal.  This gives another layer of flexibility for the cash management strategy.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to hold all your cash in normal, taxable savings accounts (although you will want a good portion there just to aid cash flow).  You can sell units inside ISA or SIPP and keep the cash balance there, under the wrapper before withdrawal.</p>



<p>This has the advantage that interest that you earn from your platform&#8217;s cash balances is tax free. It also allows you to more easily park it in money market funds if you wanted to notch up the return a bit.</p>



<p>Keeping mid-term cash inside a SIPP has the added benefit that you can choose the most tax efficient way to extract when the time is right &#8230; either through UFPLS or FAD. Between the ages of 55 &#8211; 67 you can withdraw 16K tax free (25% as tax free lump sum and the remainder within your personal allowance).</p>



<p>Managing cash in draw down is probably the most important financial activity you will undertake &#8211; only then will you find out if you&#8217;ll actually run out of money before you die.</p>



<p>Being intentional about the process right from the start will produce the best outcomes over those hopefully many years.</p>
