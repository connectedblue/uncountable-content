<p>This is a record of my first career from September 1990 to August 2019.  </p>



<p>Twenty nine years probably seems quite short to most, although I felt it quite long and varied. Since I want to spend my fifties <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/allocating-time/" data-type="post" data-id="568">allocating time how I choose</a>, it simply wasn&#8217;t realistic to have a standard 40 year career. Instead, I see <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my current activities</a> as my second thirty year career (since I hope to still be doing at least some of these things into my eighties).<br><br>At this point, this post is for historical context only. I very much hope to never need to compile a CV in the future. When I complete <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/tag/annual-reflection/">my annual reflections</a> in my diary, this post will make a useful cross reference.</p>



<p>This was also my LinkedIn profile, but since I have decided to mostly freeze that account going forward, this post should be considered the authoritative source from now on. </p>
