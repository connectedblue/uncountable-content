<p>Kathy had arranged something different today for the Stinchcombe Botany Group.  We went to some private land adjoining Breakheart Quarry where the landowner has done a great job restoring the calcareous grasslands in the last few years.</p>



<p>It was another scorching day, but tempered somewhat by the strong winds on the side of the hill.  There were six of us, so we moved quickly through the 10m grid squares without needing the flag markers.</p>



<p>I had one of the gps devices, and settled on a methodology of standing in the middle of the start of a grid (so the grid ref ended in a 5) and then walked 10m along the transect until the next grid edge was reached.  This then allowed the other surveyors to know roughly where the grid lay.</p>



<p>This was very species rich.  There were burnet saxifrage, bird&#8217;s foot trefoil, carline thistle, quaking grass, rough hawkbit, hairy violet, haresbell among the usual suspects.  In all we covered 17  grid squares, so added quite a bit to the baseline.</p>



<p>In the evening I had a call with Graham to check progress on this year&#8217;s walking festival.  He has built the walk programme into eventbrite, and I&#8217;ve found an easy way to pull this into <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a> and host the programme on that site for marketing purposes.</p>
