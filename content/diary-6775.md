<p>It&#8217;s been another <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/year-2025/" data-type="page" data-id="4070">eventful year</a>, and one that seemed to speed up as we got further through.</p>



<p>The main community focus throughout was the launch of a new website <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/#">Discover Dursley</a>, which had been talked about for a while but we started <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/01/north-bank-of-the-windrush/" data-type="post" data-id="4122">in earnest</a> at the beginning of the year with an open meeting.  </p>



<p>The site itself was ready around June for launch and we spent the second half of the year getting content in place and a social media presence established. The events section is already very vibrant, and the directory is filling up nicely. Next year, we plan to use the platform as the focus for a &#8220;26 things to do in 2026&#8221; campaign.</p>



<p>Another area of my digital life which has been enabled by AI is the consolidation of my two blogs into my <a href="https://uncountable.uk/">root domain at uncountable.uk</a>. This is a rock solid app that sits behind the scenes and automatically generates whenever I publish a post into either <a href="/#">this diary</a> or the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/">thoughts blog</a>. At some point in the future, I&#8217;d like to retire the front end of the wordpress from public view and just use it for content management. Still some way off that, but this unifying app is a huge leap forward to that goal.</p>



<p>Half way through the year, I had to adjust my planned activities quite substantially in order to help care for my mother who had fallen very ill after Easter.  Thankfully she has made a pretty good recovery now, and my siblings and I have a support plan in place going forward.</p>



<p>Through the year I continued with many conservation projects with <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/glorious-grasslands/" data-type="category" data-id="5">Glorious Grasslands</a>, <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/gloucs-wildlife-trust/" data-type="category" data-id="6">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>, <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/stroud-valleys-project/" data-type="category" data-id="7">Stroud Valleys Project</a> and <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/uley-trees-and-meadows/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="29">Uley Trees and Meadows</a>.  There were also smaller initiatives with the Dursley Environmental Land Management group and the Stinchcombe Hill botany group.</p>



<p>And <a href="https://dursleygreen.org.uk/dursley-green-drinks/">Dursley Green Drinks</a> continues to go from strength to strength with the monthly meetings.  Next year we will move to the <a href="https://www.chantrycentre.org/">Chantry Centre</a>, so a new era to look forward to for that project.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> continues to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/code-club-end-of-term-report-winter-2025/">delight and amaze</a>.  The refurbishment in the library from October meant we haven&#8217;t run them at the end of this year, but we are ready to go from January.</p>



<p>So, all in all, a very productive year and still lots to look forward to in 2026</p>
