<p>First half of the week was outdoor work, and the second half was catching up on admin and applications at home.</p>



<p>I made some useful connections with the Painswick Beacon team who I happened to hear on Tuesday had some spare electric fencing that we might be able to borrow.  As it happens, I met the guy by chance on Wednesday on a job in Painswick so things worked well.</p>



<p>However, Anna also told me that Glorious Grasslands has a load of new, never been used electric fences, so I&#8217;ll use that instead.  This is all for the goat at Wild Acres.</p>



<p>I took a team of three people I work with on other projects down to Wild Acres on Tuesday and it turned out a successful day.  Hopefully they will come back again in the future.</p>



<p>Lorna did a brilliant talk in Wotton on Thursday evening about wildflower meadow restoration in the Cotswolds.  It was videoed so I&#8217;ll be sending that link around to people when it&#8217;s available.</p>



<p>Made good progress with the wildflower survey app.  Sent to Lorna and Anna for testing, but I think that&#8217;s in the home straight.  Unlike the tree app which needs a paper version as a backup due to poor coverage.</p>



<p>The app triumph though was the artocalypse.  I have a pretty much ready set of code for the core app.  Just need a wordpress instance creating to support the backend.  </p>
