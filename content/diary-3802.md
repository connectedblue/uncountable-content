<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Away at 10am to drive down to Waikainae.  There was no traffic at all on the roads &#8211; very quite.</p>
<p>We stopped over in Palmerston North to have lunch and a look around.  Not much here really, except we picked up a great New Zealand 2011 calendar for only $3 in a sale they were having.</p>
<p>Arrived at Konini Cottage at around 4.30pm.  Nice place just a few minutes from the beach, so we took a short walk along the beach before tea.</div>
