<p>It&#8217;s always good to see a new personal website come online and Dominik <a href="https://dominikhofer.me/personal-internet-home">announced his</a> last month.  Although he thinks he&#8217;s late to the game, he&#8217;s incredibly early.  Most of his peers do not have a personal website.  And yes, I do believe the 40yo Dominik in 2041 will indeed be grateful you gifted him this.</p>



<p>I, on the other hand, am rather late to the game.  I first programmed a computer in 1981 and got immediately hooked.  So when the WWW emerged in the 90s, it didn&#8217;t take long to figure out what the pages were made out of.</p>



<p>I had a brief blogging experience in 2012 (a grand total of six posts which have been transferred here for completeness.  But I didn&#8217;t start <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my online diary</a> until 2023.  Although I enjoy keeping that up to date with all the activities I do, it&#8217;s rather constrained in format by definition and design.  So, finally in 2024 I created this blog to record my thoughts.</p>



<p>I like the design of Dominik&#8217;s site, both from a navigation and content perspective.  There&#8217;s already a lot of stuff in there, but you can see how the structure will bend and evolve over time to suit his lifestyle.</p>



<p>I wholeheartedly agree that everyone should have a personal website.  It&#8217;s the cornerstone of a digital identity that makes you feel like an active online citizen rather than a passive consumer of goopy scroll.</p>
