<p>One hundred years ago, the landscape where I live was 40% wildflower meadow.  Today it is less than 2%.  And it&#8217;s a similar picture in other rural areas of Britain.</p>



<p>The primary reason is a big change in farming practice, as focus moved to increasing yields through intensive farming techniques.  Today, if you visit the Cotswolds, you might marvel at the rolling green landscape.  But it&#8217;s an illusion.  There&#8217;s nothing in it &#8211; wildlife has been literally pushed to the margins.</p>



<p>There are projects like <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> which are trying to reverse this trend by restoring 90ha of new meadow every year.  It&#8217;s a small drop in the landscape, but at least it&#8217;s ticking in the right direction.  If we don&#8217;t take action now, then maybe the percentage drops to less than 0.5% in a few decades.</p>



<p>The restoration process is simple in principle, but logistics, policy and funding throw enough curve balls to make the operation challenging to do at scale.</p>



<p>The reason we need more wildflower meadow is to boost pollinator numbers &#8211; bees, moths and other invertebrates that feed and breed on plants.  The UK is one of the most species depleted countries in the world, and pollinators have declined 24% since 1980.</p>



<p>Once you increase pollinator numbers, you then expand the rest of the food chain that depends on them and ultimately provide the basis for reversing species decline.</p>



<p>The most effective way to create new meadow is to harvest seed from existing native perennials in nearby meadow.  Perennial because you want them coming back year after year.  Native because it needs to be suitable for the local insect population to feed and breed on.  Rows of daffodils may look pretty, but they provide literally zero service to wildlife in the UK.</p>



<p>One annual plant is important in this process however &#8211; yellow rattle.  This is semi parasitic on grass and it&#8217;s presence means that dominant grasses are paired back to allow the other herbaceous plants to compete for the light and water resources needed for growth.</p>



<p>The harvesting process is pretty straightforward &#8211; a revolving brush is dragged through the field and the seed heads collected in a hopper.  You can see more of the details in my <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/2024-seed-harvest/">2024 diary of seed harvesting</a> with Glorious Grasslands.</p>



<p>Once collected, the seed is dried in a barn for a few days until the moisture content drops to around 10%.  It can then be packed ready for the spreading stage in September and October.</p>



<p>A number of recipient sites are identified where the land owner wishes to restore part of their land back to meadow.  Ideally the recipient lies within a 15 mile radius of the donor site to ensure local genetic and species continuity.  </p>



<p>A recipient field needs to be prepared, first by cutting and then harrowing to expose pockets of bare earth.  Depending on size and available people, seed is spread either by lines of people walking up and down with a bucket, or by sitting on the back of a truck and throwing it as it drives slowly around.</p>



<p>Spreading seed at this time means it will experience a number of sub zero temperatures over the winter which stimulates the germination process. All being well, the young plants should start sprouting from the following April to July.</p>



<p>Ongoing management of the meadow is now critical. It&#8217;s important to reduce the available nutrients, otherwise the dominant grass will just sward up and out compete the wildflowers. This is done either by grazing or cutting for hay and removing the product.</p>



<p>There is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9e6vGC_6Cw">excellent online talk by Lorna from Glorious Grasslands</a> which goes through the whole process thoroughly and shows how the community can get involved.</p>



<p>Nature recovery is a necessary part of restoring habitat balance in our environment.  There are many, many ways to do this, and the best way to contribute is to look up the initiatives in your area and join them.</p>
