<p>I&#8217;m so excited to be hosting the very first <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/upcoming-blog-carnivals/">Artocalypse Blog Carnival</a>, to be held during July 2024.  </p>



<p>This is part of a series of launch events for the <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">Artocalypse</a>, a new community platform for IndieWeb Artists which uses the power of RSS to showcase their work.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a co-founder of the Artocalypse, along with <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/">Kimberly</a>.  I do the tech stuff while she handles the artistic and expo sides. </p>



<p>So, what better topic for our first carnival than</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>My Digital Art Journey</strong></p>



<p>There are a myriad of different art forms: visual, writing, performing, sculpting, musical and so on.  The digital tools available now provide a variety of different ways to express, publish or sell your art.</p>



<p>What was your journey?  </p>



<p>How do you present yourself and your art to the world?</p>



<p>I really can&#8217;t wait to read your entries.  Especially from those who probably don&#8217;t consider themselves artists like bloggers, coders, cooks, gardeners and the like.  Everyone and anyone who has a touch of artistry to their creativity.</p>
