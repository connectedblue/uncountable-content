<p>Matan talked about his writing style, and the times he is <a href="https://matanabudy.com/top-down-writer-vs-bottom-up-writer/">top-down versus bottom up</a>:  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--25">
<p>When writing blog posts for this website, I usually have an idea for a post—usually a single line of insight or thought that I want to explore—and this is all I need to start writing. I put that line in the header and just start pouring everything out of my head. I don’t plan; I just write and eventually <a href="https://matanabudy.com/should-i-post-this">just post it</a>. This is bottom-up writing.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when I write longer pieces of text, such as university assignments, I always plan. I start with the structure, expanding each high-level description or headline into smaller pieces until I know what each section will contribute to the main text and what I will write in it (in a rough sketch). I start from the top.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For me, it&#8217;s whether the piece is reactive or proactive.  When I was making a lot of posts on LinkedIn, they were almost always reactive.  Think of something, start typing and publish.  The platform algorithm did the rest.</p>



<p>As bottom-up as you can get.</p>



<p>This post is also reactive, and therefore bottom up.  I saw the post from Matan yesterday and made a mental note that I wanted to respond.  But didn&#8217;t get time until just now, when I had to think exactly what my response it.</p>



<p>More bottom up.  Maybe there&#8217;s a pattern forming here.</p>



<p>But not everything.  I write a lot about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/">my experiences with money</a> in this blog and they are always top down.  Each topic is something that I have formulated a view on over the past couple of decades, and I take time to express it as completely as I can.</p>



<p>But the order I publish these posts is bottom up (or randomly, as some might observe).  I didn&#8217;t start writing in a storybook order.  So this is why I am experimenting with something new this week:  Republishing some previous posts <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/july-2024-principles-of-investing-week/" data-type="post" data-id="965">in an order that makes more sense to read</a>.  A top down approach to scheduling.</p>
