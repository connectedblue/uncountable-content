<p>Well, I had worked ad-hoc every year since 1984, but today was the official day one of my actual career.  I had graduated with a 2:1, which was a condition for me starting at R Watson &amp; Sons as an Unqualified Actuarial Assistant.</p>



<p>I had somehow blagged this job at a prestigious private partnership on a salary of £15,000 plus Christmas bonus of £800.  And on qualification within three years, this would rise to a minimum of £36,000.  An incredible amount of money for someone who had no experience of anything (I didn&#8217;t qualify in the end, left that role in 1993 and it was the end of the decade before my salary would reach that dizzying level).</p>



<p>Still, that first day was full of promise.  I had a new Marks and Spencer suit with a suitable array of floral ties which were all the fashion back then.  I met my 21 fellow unqualified assistants for the first time as we gathered in the board room for a briefing of what to expect over that first year.</p>



<p>It was really just an extension of university but with money.  We were all the same age and it was the first day at work for everyone.  We&#8217;d all taken digs in various locations around Reigate.  One or two had partners and cars, but otherwise we were young, free, single and loaded.</p>



<p>We were expected to study, but were given time off to do so.  We&#8217;d be rotated around various departments to learn the business.  There was a great canteen so no need to cook in the evening.  Compared to other options, I had landed a pretty good gig.</p>



<p>We went down to the Wine Bar after work where the lager was £1.80 a pint.  Something I wouldn&#8217;t have dreamed of paying earlier in the summer.  But today, it felt like pocket change.  Twenty suited twenty-somethings drinking expensive lager at a wine bar in an upmarket suburban town must have looked like the worst excesses of the eighties were here to stay. I certainly hoped so.</p>



<p>One point of note. I arrived on crutches due to having had pins removed over the summer from <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/1989/04/caving-accident/" data-type="post" data-id="3639">my previous caving accident</a>. I don&#8217;t remember exactly how long I had them for, but it was a few weeks I was hobbling around the office for.</p>
