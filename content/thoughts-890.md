<p>Loren put out <a href="https://lorenblog.me/posts/reading-indie-blogs-right">an interesting post</a> on why he prefers not to use an RSS reader:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--39">
<p>I was missing out on the full indie blog experience by relying solely on a read-later app. These bloggers put time and effort into making their websites – the design, the “About Me” page, the Archives. In an app, all that disappears, replaced by a sterile, uniform layout.</p>



<p>But that’s not all. When we read through read-later apps, the bloggers themselves miss out. Their website traffic and analytics don’t reflect the actual readership they’ve cultivated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I did a post a few weeks back about why I&#8217;d actually <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/id-rather-you-didnt-read-this/" data-type="post" data-id="558">prefer if you read my posts in RSS</a> than the website itself.  </p>



<p>Firstly, it&#8217;s my content that changes the most, not the layout.  So if you&#8217;ve seen my website before (most likely when you got first the RSS feed), you don&#8217;t really need to see it again.  If I do make a major change, I&#8217;ll probably do a post on it, so you can see it then if you wish!</p>



<p>Following on from that, I&#8217;d much rather have a smaller readership that dips in now and again to my stuff, rather than a large readership who visit the website once.  When I <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/returning-to-linkedin/" data-type="post" data-id="627">returned to LinkedIn briefly</a> a few weeks ago, I did get a dopamine hit from drive-by readers who clinked on a link I promoted, but it quickly evaporates and it&#8217;s just exhausting to keep feeding those algorithms.</p>



<p>If I want to draw the reader&#8217;s attention to other related articles I&#8217;ve written, then I just link to them in the text (like I&#8217;ve done a couple of times in this post).  If you read this in RSS, you have a choice of visiting my website to delve into more if you wish.  But if you don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s OK too.</p>



<p>On the consumption side, I have about 600 feeds in RSS, and around half are personal blogs.  I do find myself clicking through to the original website when the blogger has something particularly interesting and I want to find more of what they have to say.</p>



<p>I do like looking at blog designs (the design of my site was <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/this-style-is-not-mine/" data-type="post" data-id="323">heavily influenced</a> by another blogger).  I always take a note when I first visit their site to get the feed.  I read their About page and anything else that jumps out.  </p>



<p>But after that first acquaintance, I&#8217;m generally just interested in their content.</p>
