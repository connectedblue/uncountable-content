<p>Met with Tony early to do the regular monthly riverfly check at Ebley Meadows.  With the low flow, and <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/08/low-flow-riverfly/" data-type="post" data-id="6309">yesterday&#8217;s poor numbers</a>, we weren&#8217;t holding out too much hope for this site.</p>



<p>I did the kick sample, starting a bit further downstream where the water was deeper, and Tony followed up with the hand sample.</p>



<p>As expected, we couldn&#8217;t really find very much.  There were numerous gammarus, and we slowly discovered quite a number of cased caddis.  But despite looking for 15 to 20 minutes, we couldn&#8217;t find a single example of another species.</p>



<p>In the end, the score was 4, which was also the trigger level, so we didn&#8217;t have to complete the second sample.  But this site has been poor for a two months in a row now.  Hopefully if the rain improves, the scores will be more positive next month.</p>
