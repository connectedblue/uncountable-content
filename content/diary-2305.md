<p>I&#8217;ve been running the Code Club at <a href="https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/libraries/library-locations-and-opening-hours/dursley-library/">Dursley Library</a> for a few months now.  The regular club is for 8-11 year olds and based around the Scratch programming language.</p>



<p>I decided to put on something a bit different aimed at the 11-13 age group.  This year&#8217;s activity theme is music at the library, so I designed a <a href="https://dursleycodeclub.trinket.io/introduction-to-web-programming#/html-tags-and-content/how-web-pages-work">web programming course</a> to enable them to build their own music themed website.</p>



<p>The first club was held today and 8 children attended &#8211; a full house and all the library PCs were used.  They were a super bunch, all keen to learn and creative with their own content.</p>



<p>The material I had drafted was still a bit complicated for this age group, but they all managed to get through the creation of their home page, and we had 8 published websites by the end of the first session!  A great achievement.  In future classes, they can build out further pages of content and start styling their own colours and fonts.</p>



<p>This activity is spot on for this age group.  They were super excited to actually have their own website, and they were already thinking of ideas that they can put on it.</p>
