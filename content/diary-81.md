<p>Since the pandemic I&#8217;ve been baking bread on a fortnightly cadence.  I use the same recipe and technique but the results differ mostly based on ambient room temperature.  This impacts how quickly and how well the bread rises during proving.</p>



<p>Today I was pretty pleased with the outcome.  Should be somewhat easier as the summer months roll in.</p>
