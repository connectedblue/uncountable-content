<p>Today turned out to be a day of collaborating with different parts of the local community.</p>



<p>In the morning, I sat with Rene and went through how he can build a website in wordpress to sell a local wildlife calendar.  There&#8217;s a lot of functionality that he needs right out the box with woocommerce, so hopefully it won&#8217;t take him too long to get a basic site live.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I visited Dave at  <a href="https://ashenplains.co.uk/">Ashen Plains Campsite</a> and discussed the details of an event which they are supporting for this year&#8217;s walking festival.  I had a tour of his whole site and there&#8217;s some really interesting capabilities which he has built out for outdoor events.</p>



<p>In the evening was the scheduled <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/">Dursley Green Drinks</a>.  This was the best attended yet &#8211; over 25 people and several huddles of conversation taking place on the lawn of <a href="https://www.kingshillhouse.org.uk/">Kingshill House</a>.</p>



<p>The whole idea of Dursley Green Drinks was to just connect people in a relaxed environment.  It seems to be working, and growing, so we&#8217;ll book in dates for the next three months.</p>
