<p>I usually only put at most two things per day in the calendar, but occasionally more appointments find their way in.  Up early this morning to get my hair cut at 8am, which is always useful to be early when there are other things to do.</p>



<p>Immediately after, I headed over to the Cam for the regular fortnightly check of the rafts.  Nothing at all on the first one, although it had been almost continuously raining over the weekend, so signs could have been washed away.  The second raft was flooded over the bank and was unsafe to access.  Next time I do these, Pete will accompany me and we&#8217;ll refresh all the cartridges.</p>



<p>I got back to Dursley in time to meet Georgie for coffee.  It&#8217;s been a while since we met, but lots of progress on her Let&#8217;s Create venture.  I could also update on some equipment we have at Code Club and there could be a potential &#8220;pop-up&#8221; collaboration in the future.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, it was the first of this week&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  We&#8217;re back into a regular routine now and the children have their projects for this term.  The new chromebooks are particularly valuable for the allowing them to try Unity.</p>
