<p>The river bank changes every fortnight I come over for the raft checks for <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>. Today the banks were covered in flowering wild mustard and comfrey.</p>



<p>Not too much to report on the rafts again this week, although there were prints finally captured on the cartridge. Just brown rat, but at least an indicator they are still working correctly and not dried out.</p>



<p>I made some bread when I got back home, which I can take to the Wild Acres picnic tomorrow.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I went to the library for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  I was astonished, yet again, by the complexity and depth which the children apply to using AI to produce solutions.</p>



<p>One boy made a browser based app to measure your walking speed using GPS.  And it seemed to work!  Another went to enormous lengths to specify the plan for a project with AI, before kicking off the more expensive AI agent mode.  The result was a very usable and impressive 3D browser game made with just one credit.</p>



<p>Yet others were using AI to produce the code for pretty slick interactive web pages hosted on neocities.  It&#8217;s hard to overstate quite how much ahead of the game they all are.</p>
