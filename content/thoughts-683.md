<p>A brilliant and simple idea from <a href="https://birming.com/junited-how-who/">Robert (just another swede)</a> to connect and share during the month of June.</p>



<p>I will update this post with a list of links that inspire and deserve to be shared.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First up is <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/weblogpomo-2024-retrospective-communities-of-content">Apple Annie&#8217;s retrospective of the WeblogPoMo</a>. I didn&#8217;t participate, but enjoyed the influx of posts from others into my RSS reader each day. I wholeheartedly agree that intimate connection through community is the joy of blogging.</li>



<li>An intriguing <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-summer-2024-blog-post-competition">summer blogging competition</a> by Adam Mastroianni with prizes. I have an idea which I&#8217;m working on to enter.</li>



<li>Juha-Matti wrote about <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/what-does-it-feel-like-to-read-rss-feeds/">how it feels to read RSS feeds</a> and I whole-heartedly agree. I have exactly the same experience and I just wonder quite what I did when I wasn&#8217;t using an RSS reader.</li>



<li>An interesting conversation between Charley Johnson and Tamara Kneese on the subject of <a href="https://untangled.substack.com/p/what-happens-online-when-we-die">what happens online when we die</a>. This is good background for my ongoing project to have <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">my writing being read in 200 years</a> time.</li>



<li>An alternative way to <a href="https://www.dhewi.co.uk/posts/living-cheaply-by-choice/">live cheaply by choice</a> by my LinkedIn friend Daryl which I was happy to read in my RSS app first before I saw he also posted the onto LinkedIn.</li>



<li>Rebecca Toh followed through on her dream idea and created a shared community library in Singapore called the <a href="https://rebeccatoh.co/casual-poet-library/">casual poet library</a>.</li>



<li>Manu mused about <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/the-money-conundrum">the money conundrum</a>, something which I have a lot of thoughts on. I made a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/the-money-conundrum/" data-type="post" data-id="791">reply post here</a>.</li>



<li>Nathan gave a very <a href="https://knowler.dev/blog/maintaining-dotfiles">simple recipe for maintaining dotfiles</a>.  I didn&#8217;t know you could have a git repo without a checked out worktree.  Nor have I ever issued git commands against a repo called something other than <code>.git</code>. </li>
</ul>
