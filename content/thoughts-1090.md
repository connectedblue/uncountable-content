<p>Recently I had an email exchange with <a href="https://chrislt.art/">Chris Lovie-Tyler Art</a> on why <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/not-on-google/" data-type="post" data-id="515">I&#8217;m not on google</a>, so I thought I&#8217;d expand on the reasons here.</p>



<p>The reason started out through annoyance but has since developed into a more nuanced strategy.</p>



<p>I was on the Google console for a year with my diary. I had about 200 posts but Google only indexed about half of them and kept complaining about the others. Despite everything I tried, I couldn&#8217;t ever get the full set indexed.  </p>



<p>For example, it would flag a diary entry (which, by definition, was unique to me, photos and all) and say &#8220;this is not the canonical version&#8221;. </p>



<p>In the end, I thought to myself &#8220;screw you&#8221;. If you&#8217;re not going to index them all, then you can&#8217;t index any.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to randomly decide what&#8217;s important.</p>



<p>So I added <code>noindex, nofollow</code> to all content coming from the <code>uncountable.uk</code> domain.  From now on, I only want to be stumbled upon, not regurgitated from some big tech algorithm.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m doubling down on being discovered in indie web.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/elevate-your-websites-rss-feed/" data-type="post" data-id="1061">elevated the RSS experience</a> recently for subscribers and see that as the primary channel to focus on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My main RSS feed and homepage will become a more considered place.  If someone has gone to the trouble of adding my URL to their reader, I don&#8217;t want to repay that by throwing out six random things in rapid succession and then nothing for days. </p>



<p>My primary concern is the RSS audience, which means curating a schedule of content that is a bit more intentional.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also making RSS only content that doesn&#8217;t appear anywhere else in the website navigation.</p>



<p>I still publish random stuff elsewhere in the site &#8211; I just make sure wordpress excludes it from the home and RSS feeds to keep them more predictable for readers.</p>



<p>I also participate in blog carnivals, reply to other blog posts and put my blog in as many indie web directories as possible.&nbsp; It is an experiment in being small and focused and community oriented.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not about clicks and eyeballs for me.</p>



<p>But, I&#8217;m not looking to monetise in any shape or form.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s not a strategy that would suit everyone.</p>



<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think google, FB, linkedin could enhance my digital life.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to conform to their notion of &#8220;what makes good content&#8221;.  They could go away or change the rules or anything.&nbsp; </p>



<p>I just get enormous satisfaction from <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">writing my diary</a>, blogging and interacting with people.</p>



<p>In any case, I actually have a much, much bigger audience goal than google could provide anyway.  I want to be capable of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">being read in 200 years</a> time. </p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t made any progress towards that yet, but I&#8217;ll keep you updated.</p>
