<p>I met with Pete from the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> at 10am to work on repairing a monitoring raft that overturned just before Christmas.  The river has been far to high to safely go in and sort out.  The clay cartridge and oasis was lost so a new one needed to be prepared.</p>



<p>In the end, it was pretty easy to sort it out.  A tree had fallen on the raft and tangled the guy rope.  With Pete on the bank, I was able to lift it out and he levered it onto land.</p>



<p>We then had a discussion about the tree survey, and hatched a plan to make it easier to collect in the field for surveyors.  I then went off to check the other two rafts, as I do every fortnight.  There were potential water vole signs at one, and none at the other.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I held the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> in the library.  All eight PCs were in use, and everyone worked on a variety of projects, from scratch to python to web pages.</p>



<p>In the evening, we held the AGM for <a href="https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Welcomes Walkers</a>.  There was a potential organisation issue due to a member standing down which would have impacted this year&#8217;s <a href="https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Walking Festival</a>.  However, two people stepped forward to fill the roles, and planning can commence as usual over the summer.</p>
