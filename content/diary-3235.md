<p>Bank holiday today, and a couple of tasks to catch up on.  I headed out in the morning, just before the rain, to do the regular raft check for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.</p>



<p>Not much to report today &#8211; some otter speint on one of the rafts, but that was about it.  The buttercups are out in full force, and the paths along the brook are starting to get a lot of vegetation.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I met with Toby to survey the car park for ideas for the town&#8217;s environment land management plan.  There&#8217;s not much inspiration to take &#8211; large parts of it are heavily shaded by the surrounding buildings, but there are some areas which would take native hedging.</p>
