<p>Went up to Uley Common this morning to finish off the raking after the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2026/01/continuing-the-common-restoration/" data-type="post" data-id="6834">habitat management session last Sunday</a>.</p>



<p>Took extra care to rake the woodland edge side well because there is a large amount of leaf litter.  It may well be that this area is too rich in nutrient for the grassland to spread to, but we&#8217;ll see after the growing season.</p>



<p>In the afternoon held the second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> of the week, and this was well attended, including one new person.  Lots of creative projects made today, including a maths quiz and a prank web page.</p>
