<p>The upcoming UK budget on 26 October is yet again hotly anticipated.  So, I thought I&#8217;d continue my tradition of making some predictions which I can review afterwards to see how many came to pass.</p>



<p>For the record, it&#8217;s October 26 when I write this, a month before the budget itself. In no particular order, here is what I think we&#8217;ll see:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reduce the threshold that small business have to started collecting VAT to £30,000.</li>



<li>Increase the mid tax band from 40% to 41%.</li>



<li>Freeze the basic state pension and move the triple lock onto Pension Credit instead.</li>



<li>Wealth tax of 1% for people with assets of over £10m.</li>



<li>Remove the &#8220;rollover allowance&#8221; for when the first person in a couple dies and leaves their entire estate to their spouse. In other words, on the death of the second spouse, only one lot of tax free band applies for inheritance tax purposes.</li>



<li>Reduce maximum annual SIPP contributions from £60,000 to £40,000.</li>



<li>Reduce maximum tax free cash to £200,000, but retain the rate at 25%.</li>



<li>Remove the tax free transfer of ISA on death of a spouse (currently the surviving spouse has their £20,000 annual ISA limit increased temporarily by the amount of their partner&#8217;s ISA on death.  This allows it to be transferred intact to the survivor&#8217;s ISA account).</li>
</ul>



<p>And for completeness, here&#8217;s a list of things I don&#8217;t think will be touched:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Overall cap on ISA portfolio.</li>



<li>No scrapping of SIPP tax free cash</li>



<li>ISA contribution limit remains at £20,000.</li>
</ul>



<p>That&#8217;s my predictions locked in now &#8230; I&#8217;ll write a review post after the budget to see how much I got right and wrong.</p>
