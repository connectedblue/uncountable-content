<p>Today is  <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a>. It occurs twice a year on the longest and shortest day and is a chance for volunteers to reflect on the list of things they do, and decide if some changes need to be made to prevent them burning out.</p>



<p>I volunteer with several organisations. It&#8217;s a really important way to get <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">structure, identity and purpose</a> after you stop work. But it can get overwhelming. There are just so many interesting things to get involved with, it&#8217;s easy to over commit.</p>



<p>I found out about this day on the 2024 summer solstice, June 2024, and took the opportunity to do <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/" data-type="post" data-id="797">an inventory of everything</a>.  Not to prune straight away, but just to capture everything.</p>



<p>For me, this is a great way to constantly review what I do and not to be afraid to drop something if necessary.  So I&#8217;ve undertaken to myself to do this review twice a year.  </p>



<p>As it happens, there have been some major changes to some long term volunteering over the summer and some minor ones.  </p>



<p>The main decision was to step back from organising the <a href="https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Walking Festival</a>.  My final one was this year, 2024, and that is four that I have worked hard on.  I divided my tasks into 7 different roles and others have stepped up to take them on.  I can hand over these activities slowly and thoroughly over the next year, which hopefully will result in a successful festival in 2025.  </p>



<p>This will free up significant time for me over the summer, when I found myself locked in my room on a number of days getting things done for the festival.</p>



<p>The second major change was that Wild Acres closed it&#8217;s doors in November. I&#8217;ve been going to this <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/wild-acres/">every Tuesday</a> for around three years so it&#8217;s a big change. I&#8217;ll be looking for something regular to do on Tuesday mornings (in the afternoon, I run the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> in the library).</p>



<p>Some minor changes in other activities.  I haven&#8217;t been to so many work parties with the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/gloucestershire-vale-conservation-volunteers/">Gloucestershire Vale Conservation Volunteers</a> in the latter part of the year, but I&#8217;m on the email list and will try to get along from time to time.  I also organised a wordpress course for the library as part of the Space to Create initiative, but the outcomes didn&#8217;t justify the effort put in.  It was good to have done it, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ll be carrying on.</p>



<p>The Canal Tree survey was something I started but didn&#8217;t finish due to the complexity of some of the data updates through the app I built.  If it carries on in the future, it would have to be under a different technical solution.</p>



<p>And a couple of local initiatives started recently that I&#8217;m involved in the organisation of.  The first is a habitat mangement of grasslands in the area, and the second is <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a>, a new community website to bring together all the activities in the local town in one place.</p>



<p>So, here is my current list of volunteering activities that reflect the above and other changes.</p>
