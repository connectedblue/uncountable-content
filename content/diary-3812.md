<p>We left heathrow on 28 December at 9.05pm and finally arrived today at 11am, after stopping in Hong Kong for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Took a bus to downtown Auckland and we were checked into the apartment by 1pm.  Very nice appartment, although the rest of the building decoration must be on hold until phase 2 &#8211; very bare walls in all the lobby areas.</p>
<p>Very tired today, but we went out to explore and looked around the harbour area.  Found a supermarket and topped up with a few days supplies.</p>
<p>Christopher still had heavy cold from boxing day.</p>
