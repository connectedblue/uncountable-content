<p>This week has been mostly about progressing various community projects I&#8217;m involved with.</p>



<p>On Tuesday and Thursday, I held the summer sessions for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> in the library.  The Thursday session has been web programming and the children are making remarkable progress at styling their sites they&#8217;ve been building the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>On Thursday evening, I had a chance to catch up with Jo and we discussed different ideas for taking forward <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleygreendrinks/">Dursley Green Drinks</a>.</p>



<p>Most days this week, I&#8217;ve also been working on the festival website for <a href="https://dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Welcomes Walkers</a>.  It&#8217;s nearly done, but there&#8217;s still a few loose ends to tie up.</p>



<p>And Tuesday was also the regular Visit Dursley call, which happens every three months.  This is a great way for local organisations to connect, share information and collaborate.  On the back of that meeting, I&#8217;ve met with Zoe and Helen who will be producing some in store displays to support the walking festival.  Also discussed with Nola how we can incorporate some events from the <a href="https://www.tyndalearts.co.uk/">Tyndale Arts Festival</a> into our programme to cross promote.  </p>



<p></p>



<p>And today I agreed the final shape of a mobile Escape Room that <a href="https://www.theengine.org.uk/">The Engine</a> will provide as a special event on the sunday of the walking festival.</p>
