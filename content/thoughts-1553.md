<p>I&#8217;ve had a bit of an epiphany over the last few weeks.  It all started when my friend <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/">Kimberly</a> questioned why we were using the phase &#8220;indie web artists&#8221; on <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">the Artocalypse</a> (an online art community we both run). </p>



<p>She thinks we should use &#8220;independent web artist&#8221; instead, which builds on the notion of an independent artist.  But I was adamant in my viewpoint that this thing we are all part of is called the Indie Web.</p>



<p>There have also been a number of posts lately about the Indie Web as an organisation and a set of technologies which have clarified my thinking (<a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/smaller/">Minutes to midnight</a> and <a href="https://lilymara.xyz/posts/2024-technoelitism/">Lily</a> wrote about why they are moving away from the concept and <a href="https://artlung.com/blog/2024/08/25/post-xoxo-ramble/">Joe Crawford</a> is impatient to move faster toward it) .  </p>



<p>I have been on some Indie Web zoom calls, I&#8217;m in the discord and take part in the blog carnivals.  I am totally sold on <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> as the primary method of creating content.  I also love the community aspects where you do not at all feel like you&#8217;re blogging into the void &#8211; people not only read your work, they also reply and build on the ideas.  There is truly a feeling of a global conversation that we can have from our own individual websites.</p>



<p>But, on the other hand, I was beginning to question what the overall aims were &#8230; I wrote a post a couple of months back asking whether the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/is-the-indieweb-bar-too-high/" data-type="post" data-id="866">Indie Web bar was too high</a> for newcomers.  </p>



<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t get excited by Webmention, ActivityPub, micro formats and other paraphernalia that seem to have the goal of making your website just like facebook when it comes to social interaction.</p>



<p>Yet RSS, email, discord, blog carnivals, reply posts, blog challenges all seem to fill the social networking superbly.  Some time ago, I wrote a reply to Tracy Durnell who was asking what is it that builds <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/03/01/indieweb-interactions-what-builds-connection/">connection on the IndieWeb</a>.  My take was that it&#8217;s the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/human-protocols/" data-type="post" data-id="497">human protocols, not the technical ones</a> that will be the ultimate differentiation between the independent web and the billionaire web.</p>



<p>In August 2024, I had another amazing, but different, social experience when I joined the <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/">Blaugust community</a> for a month of blogging.   Yes, I did happen to complete the challenge and posted something every day during the month.  But that aspect was really a side product.  </p>



<p>The most incredible thing about that event was the community.  The event has been going for ten years and came very much from the gamer community.  Gamers know instinctively more than anyone else how to build online communities.  They&#8217;ve been doing it quietly in their own spaces  for years, while all us non-gamers were busy throwing shade around social networks to pass the time.</p>



<p>Just last night in the Blaugust discord, there was a huge discussion about whether websites are best read in RSS or on the original website (yes, that old favourite chestnut).  But, the conversation was extremely engaging &#8211; multiple views expressed, respectful counter arguments, link references to other sources, thoughtful contributions &#8211; all of which led to a greater understanding of the pros and cons, without any hint of toxicity or sniping.</p>



<p>So, whereabouts are all these ideas landing me today?  </p>



<p>I feel very strongly that I am an active participant in the Independent Web. I regularly write in two blogs, I run a community to showcase artist&#8217;s websites, I keep up with 600+ blogs in RSS, I write entries in other people&#8217;s guestbooks. And so on.</p>



<p>But most of all, I feel that I am part of an online supportive culture that refuses to join the billionaire&#8217;s club, and will do anything and everything possible to further human connection.</p>
