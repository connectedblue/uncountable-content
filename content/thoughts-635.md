<p>In response to my post about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">wanting to be read in 200 years</a>, my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardmclean/">Gerard</a> responded on LinkedIn, which I can&#8217;t link to, so here&#8217;s the quote</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--13">
<p>If you want to do the heavy lifting, tips are free… if you want us to lift, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sharktooth-press/">Sharktooth Press</a> is my imprint that will charge you massive amounts of cash for a legacy 😀😀😀 Seriously, though, that’s really the whole market for the imprint… legacy.<br><br>Read your blog post.. YEEEESSSSS!!!! 1000 times, yes. I think about that stuff, too and you’ve hit spot on. Text files and the medium they are stored on… I’ve got SyQuest cartridges, CD-ROMs, ZIP Drives… 5.25 floppies… none of that is really readable anymore so I keep shifting to the latest medium… these days it’s a set of 2T flash drives, redundant storage because … failure… paper burns though, so even books aren’t safe…<br><br>A good book to read if you really want to be terrified about archiving human knowledge… Double Fold …</p>

<p>I created this post to so I can remember what he said. Already I have two pieces of knowledge &#8211; there are companies out there who will help on this journey. And secondly, a really interesting book recommendation.</p>



<p>But, more than that, this blog can act as a record of how I go about this archiving project.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m <a href="/topic/future-archive/">creating a tag</a> so to keep all the related information together. I&#8217;m feeling motivated to start and see where it takes me.</p>



<p>This post is the official start of the journey toward a solution &#8230;</p>
