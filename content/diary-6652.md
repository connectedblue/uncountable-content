<p>Over the last couple of years, an informal group of local people gathered to participate in various <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/uley-trees-and-meadows/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="29">biodiversity initiatives around Uley</a>.  The scope has grown in both size and complexity, so we decided to formally constitute the group as an unincorporated association to be the vehicle for funding and managing the activities.</p>



<p>A group of eight gathered at 7pm in the room behind the church to formally agree to start a group and tackle the initial order of business.  We had a draft constitution which had been reviewed and commented on over WhatsApp, and after a final clarifying discussion voted unanimously to start the Uley Trees and Meadows organisation.</p>



<p>Then a round of appointing the committee.  There was an incredible amount of expertise around the table, but more importantly, everyone has been involved in organising things before &#8211; critical for success.  </p>



<p>We will start with four major projects, and had a task leader appointed for each one, as well as other leads on community engagement and farming.  It&#8217;s a really strong team and will really enable organizational credibility to be built up within the community.</p>



<p>The future looks bright.</p>
