<p>The <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">Artocalypse</a> is an online community of artists who put on expos a few times a year.  The current one launched in November 2025 is <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2025-ink-small-expo-and-swap/">Ink Small &amp; Swap</a>.</p>



<p>The artistic director and curator is <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/">Kimberly</a> who has surpassed herself this time with a collaborative and creative expo.  </p>



<p>The core idea was to create a small ink drawing on 2.5&#8243;x3.5&#8243; card.  The artists then swapped addresses with each other and sent the physical art to each other.  A brilliantly simple idea to allow artists to connect across countries and continents.</p>



<p>The pieces are really stunning.  You can check them out on <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2025-ink-small-expo-and-swap/">the expo website</a> and also read the background story by the artist.</p>
