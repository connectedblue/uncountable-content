<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Got up early to head to Fox Glacier for the all day walk.</p>
<p>There was quite a bit of rock fall after yesterday&#8217;s weather so the all day was canceled.  We were going to wait to see if the afternoon hike was on, but after a while the weather got worse so we got our money back.  Went to Lake Matheson instead which is a great place to see the reflections of the mountains, but unfortunately there were none today as it was so cloudy.</p>
<p>We  drove to the Glacier view points and did a few short walks around the bush in the area.  Fox glacier is pretty impressive and comes pretty close to the access road.   </div>
