<p>I only have 170 posts on this blog but already I can&#8217;t keep track of articles I&#8217;ve already written.  Quite often I have the sense of having written an idea before, but I can&#8217;t find the reference.</p>



<p>I try to treat my posts as a wiki where I can, cross linking ideas instead of repeating them.  But I have no idea what system I can use when I reach 500, 1000, 2000 posts.  </p>
