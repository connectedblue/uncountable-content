<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>



<p>My name is Chris and currently live in the Cotswolds. I <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/stopping-work/" data-type="post" data-id="575">stopped work</a> back in 2019, aged 51, and restructured my lifestyle since then around 5 or 6 nature recovery projects across my local area.</p>



<p>My main passions are conservation, computer science and <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-accumulate-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="676">lifestyle investing</a>. I also enjoy walking and networking across the local community.</p>



<p>This blog is where I share my thoughts on various topics which interest me. I welcome conversations on these.  So <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/ask-me-stuff/" data-type="post" data-id="762">ask me stuff</a>, if you wish. </p>



<p>I also have <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">this diary</a> to track my day to day activities.  </p>



<p>I am a member of <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">The Artocalypse</a>, a community of IndieWeb artists which I co-founded.</p>
