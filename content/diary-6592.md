<p>My friend Andy organises bird walks for a U3A group in the North Cotswolds, and a few months ago did <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/07/touring-fromebridge/" data-type="post" data-id="6287">a recce at Fromebridge</a> for the walk taking place today.  </p>



<p>I got to the mill car park early because one of the roads was due for closure at 9.30am and it was an unexpected hive of activity.  I bumped into Tony, Barry, Pete and Nick who were all there for different things (unrelated to my walk).  There was an early morning press event to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgmd1egk65o">announce major new funding</a> for the next phase of the canal project.</p>



<p>I met up with Andy and the rest of the group and we set off around 10am towards the reserve.  There&#8217;s such a lot to say almost every 50m about the project.  I&#8217;ve been involved four years, and the transformation everywhere is incredible.  The first part of the walk we went past the new ponds and down to the bird hide.   We stayed there quite a while and observed different species out in the reserve.  Sadly the scrapes weren&#8217;t filled up otherwise we might have seen more.</p>



<p>We then headed over to Occupation Bridge where I could give an overview of all the different parts of the reserve, including the story of the oil pipeline.  We then wandered up into the orchard where I could show the old fruit trees and graft lines, and how we have restored the whole area in the last few years.</p>



<p>In the species rich grassland, we spotted fieldfare, which I&#8217;ve not seen there before.</p>



<p>We finished up around midday when the group went off for lunch.  Loads of excellent and interested questions from everyone, and it&#8217;s a real pleasure to show people the around the reserve and what we have created. </p>
