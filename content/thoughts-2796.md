<p>The annual year end Artocalypse expo is now <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2025-end-of-year-artist-feature/">open to view online</a>.</p>



<p>Just scrolling through the list of participating artists, you can see there is exceptional talent on display.</p>



<p>Dive into any of the exhibits and you&#8217;ll find more work and an interview to get the thoughts of the artist.</p>



<p>Huge credit and thanks to <a href="https://iamkimberly.org/">Kimberly RL</a> who curated the expo.  She has put together <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/">a number of expos now</a>, and is one of the finest digital curators out there.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s even more coming to the Artocalypse in 2026.  We aim to provide a dedicated space, away from the noise of social media, where art and artists can shine alongside each other.</p>
