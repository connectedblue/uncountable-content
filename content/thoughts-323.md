<p>Around March 2024, I started to spend a lot more time on the IndieWeb.  I had been keeping a <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">blog diary</a> for about a year.  This has been a great experience for me, and I plan to keep it going.</p>



<p>At the same time, I had an urge to write more freely about all sorts of topics that just wouldn&#8217;t make sense in the diary format I had.  So I took the decision to make a second blog and started hunting around for inspiration for how it should look.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to spend too long on the IndieWeb before you come across <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manuel Moreale</a>.  I fell in love with his layout the moment I saw it.  Black and white, free of clutter and optimised for reading.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m afraid I rather unashamedly copied it.  I added a dark mode option, because I prefer that, but otherwise it&#8217;s pretty much the same.  I had the blog set up over the Easter weekend.</p>



<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been writing every day, sometimes several times.  The simple layout has also inspired me to just hit &#8220;new post&#8221; and start writing.  The site is beginning to organise itself around how I think, almost by magic.</p>



<p>So, thank you Manu, for starting me on this journey.  I hope you don&#8217;t mind that I took your style, but I&#8217;m not taking the credit.  </p>
