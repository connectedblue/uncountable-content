<p>Getting this website into <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/this-style-is-not-mine/">a style that I like</a>, and writing initial content has been front and centre each day.  Already it feels like something which encourages me to pick up and write.  I&#8217;ve been surprised by how often I have  written a piece.</p>



<p>Not so much outdoor activity, as habitat management comes to an end.  The usual <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/04/clearing-around-the-mud-kitchen/">wild acres</a> Tuesday followed by the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/04/kicking-off-the-tree-survey/">initial tree survey</a> on Wednesday.</p>



<p>On Thursday I met with <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/04/london-calling/">people from school</a> in London.  I travelled there with Dave, who I see regularly as he lives close by.  We had out usual stream of tech chat, which left me with more angles to explore.</p>



<p>RSS has been an obsessive thread through these past few weeks.  Although it&#8217;s clunky and out of reach for most people, I still think it&#8217;s the building block to escape social media but still stay in touch.  I&#8217;m going to experiment with an RSS experience on the Artocalypse to try and produce a discovery service.</p>



<p>And IndieWeb is influencing me heavily.  I entered my first <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/april-indieweb-blog-carnival/">blog carnival</a> and put <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/carnival-host/">my name down</a> to host one next year.  Week Notes are standard fare on IndieWeb sites, as is a blog roll.</p>



<p>I also reached out to two prominent bloggers on the IndieWeb, as well as the carnival host.  So that&#8217;s three people I have contacted, and received a reply from over email.  Social contact without a social network.</p>



<p>That spurs me on to explore more on how digital life outside of big tech can be.</p>
