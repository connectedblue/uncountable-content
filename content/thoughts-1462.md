<p>Like most people with a personal website, this exists only for my own amusement. I put whatever I want in here, whenever I want.</p>



<p>But I also know I have readers too. Some I know in real life, some online and some I&#8217;ve never interacted with. Some visit the homepage directly and others read through RSS.</p>



<p>On most blogs, the default display on the main home and RSS feed is &#8220;here is the last thing I wrote&#8221;.  Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve been re-orienting mine to mean &#8220;here&#8217;s what I want to show you next&#8221;.</p>



<p>In other words, the home page is just a simple way for me to unfold an ongoing story to you.</p>



<p>So I choose one article a day and schedule it in advance.  At the time of writing, I have a week and a half of posts lined up, one per day.  This means that time spent updating my website is in in two parts:  one is just me in purely writing mode, and the other is me as an editor, trying to sequence content in a suitable order for readers.</p>



<p>There are other parts of my site which are of interest only to me, so that&#8217;s where I stick other stuff instead of cluttering my home page.  For example, you probably don&#8217;t want to read about my <a href="/topic/quick-thoughts/">quick thoughts</a> or my <a href="/thoughts-on/princeton-companion-to-mathematics/">ongoing reading project</a>.  And soon I will be importing the 700+ posts I made to LinkedIn between 2018 and 2022.  These are all part of my ongoing attempt to be <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">read in 200 years</a> time, but of little value to anyone else.</p>



<p>One consequence of the &#8220;here&#8217;s what I want to show you next&#8221; approach is that I may republish something you have seen before, either on other parts of the site you stumbled into, or even the home page.  </p>



<p>A bit like repeats on TV (which everyone seems to complain about).  But I prefer to think of it more as replaying a greatest hits album.  </p>



<p>I like rereading my old posts, and if I come across one I thought was good, I&#8217;ll stick in in the schedule as something I want to show you next.</p>
