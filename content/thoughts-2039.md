<p>Some time ago, I implemented <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/styling-external-links/" data-type="post" data-id="1504">north east arrows</a> on my external links to provide a visual differentiator for readers.  So something <a href="https://dursleygreen.org.uk/">like this</a>. Over the holidays, my brother sent me a screen shot of one of my posts and I was horrified by the ugly block arrows on his iPhone.  They are supposed to be subtle.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s almost certainly something to do with the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/modern-font-stack/" data-type="post" data-id="1497">modern font stacks</a> I use where that character doesn&#8217;t render well on whatever the default font family is on the iPhone.  Another thing to put on the list of things to fix.</p>
