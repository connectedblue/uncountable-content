<p>The <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/indieweb-carnival-may-round-up-post-creative-environments/" data-type="link" data-id="https://hamatti.org/posts/indieweb-carnival-may-round-up-post-creative-environments/">May IndieWeb Blog Carnival</a> hosted by Juha-Matti Santala has just come to an end.  He did a terrific job of hosting &#8211; a great topic and fabulous roundup of all the entries.</p>



<p>Reading the articles also gives me a chance to update my RSS reader with more authors I want to follow.  </p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have the stamina to take part in the <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024">WeblogPomo</a>, which involved blogging every day during May.  But a lot of people in my feed did and it was great to see them pop up daily.</p>



<p>If you want to take part in the June Blog carnival, head over to <a href="https://andrei.xyz/post/indieweb-carnival-june-2024-diy-something-from-nothing/">Andrei&#8217;s host page</a> where the topic is &#8220;DIY &#8211; Something from (Almost) Nothing&#8221;.  It&#8217;s free to enter and a great way to feel part of the blogging community.</p>
