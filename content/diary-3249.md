<p>It&#8217;s been a little while since we did a tree survey due to the coverage problems with updating the app.  However, three of us decided to give it another go, this time starting at a section further along where the coverage is better.</p>



<p>We had good success.  We spent a couple of hours doing a section from the A38 heading back towards Saul Junction.  There has been quite a lot of management here in the period since the last survey, so it took a while to update some of the records.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also useful having other people use the app.  We identified a couple of optimisations that we can make to the survey methodology, which should make it a bit quicker for the next one.</p>
