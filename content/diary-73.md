<p>This has been in the calendar for a while.  The first <a href="https://dataday.org.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dataday.org.uk/">Gloucestershire Data Day</a> was organised by a few local organisations to discuss how we use data for the benefit of the community.</p>



<p>The day got off to an unusual start.  I arrived at the venue and realised I had left my phone at home &#8211; something I haven&#8217;t done for a decade or so.  So I had to arm myself with a pen and paper to write down contact details. Sadly it also meant I couldn&#8217;t get any photos from the day.</p>



<p>It was very successful though and everything I had hoped.  The diversity of organisations and data use was enormous but there was a clear desire to collaborate more. Of course, events like these are a good way to expand a network.  I met a few people I already knew and made some valuable new contacts.</p>
