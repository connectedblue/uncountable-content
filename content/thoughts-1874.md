<p>Zoe is <a href="https://zoeloukia.bearblog.dev/need-feedback-for-a-creative-idea/">pondering video collages</a> as an additional way to journal:</p>

<p>I just want a way to combine my visual, writing, and musical hobbies all into one. I&#8217;m thinking I layer piano diddles that I do (just experimenting, no piece in general playing around) over clips of whatever subject I want, like above, and maybe layering voice or text over it. Or even better yet, no words in the actual video, and I annotate the contents of the video in a blog post that&#8217;s published with it?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I keep a photo collage with occasional videos on the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/snapshots/">snapshot page</a> of my diary.  It&#8217;s hosted on Google Photos and very easy to maintain.  When I take a picture or video, I just add a caption and move it to a folder called &#8220;Instadiary&#8221; and it appears automatically on my website.  No friction or fuss &#8211; all done from my phone when I&#8217;m out and about (or later in the evening).</p>



<p>I use a wordpress plugin called <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/photonic/">Phototonic</a> and a little bit of custom CSS to display this how I want on my website, but you don&#8217;t even need to be that fancy.  Google Photo albums come with a share link, so you can just create a cover image/button/link on your website that clicks through to that folder.  It&#8217;s rough and ready (you have to click on videos/photos to see the caption), but it&#8217;s a free and quick way to display the montage on your blog.</p>



<p>One thing to be aware of if you share the folder directly &#8211; viewers can download the folder contents in the orginal resolution.  If you care about that, then you might want to resize first before adding to the album.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t use social media, and prefer to keep all my online journal activity on my own domain.  Photo and video management can be costly and complex to manage yourself, so I don&#8217;t mind outsourcing that to Google.  The important thing for me is ease of use &#8211; with my system, I can take a photo or video and add it immediately to my site.  No need to post process or update a CMS or anything.  </p>



<p>Since starting my montage in late 2022, I have added over 500 photos with captions.  I don&#8217;t think I would have achieved that if I had to curate handmade galleries on my website instead.</p>



<p>Google photos can be exported using Takeout, but the caption data is stored in a seperate file which you would need special tooling to import into a new home.  I have enough technical skill to not worry about that, but it&#8217;s a consideration if you want to avoid lock in.</p>
