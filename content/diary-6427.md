<p>Met with Charlie for an early morning coffee to chew through some common projects we have.  I see her quite often in various places around town, but we never actually get a chance to sit down and talk through things properly.</p>



<p>So we spent a good two hours talking around various topics and things coming up.  There&#8217;s quite an exciting opportunity with the escape room, the school and the code club, so I&#8217;m hoping that will turn into something over the next few months.</p>



<p>Afterwards, I headed over to Lister Road to do a riverfly sample with Susie. We haven&#8217;t done one there for a couple of months due to one reason or another, so it was good to get the record established again.</p>



<p>However, the numbers weren&#8217;t looking all that good, which chimes with recent readings on the Frome.  We had a score of 4, but this site is normally very species rich so that&#8217;s very low.  We&#8217;ve not yet been assigned a trigger level by the EA, but I feel this might have been a breach if we had.</p>



<p>In the afternoon I headed down to the library for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  This is the last session of this term due to a forthcoming refurbishment.  The usual children attended and it was good to see them all make progress on where they are with their journey.  I won&#8217;t be seeing them now until the new January term.</p>
