<p>If you are new to investing, you have a lot of information and new concepts to absorb.  You can use my blog for some inspiration, but please remember I am not a financial advisor of any sort.  </p>



<p>I write only from my own experiences, and I try to be as accurate as I can, although I can&#8217;t recall or relate every twist and turn of my 25+ year journey.</p>



<p>That said, if you do want to see what I have to say, the following article order and grouping will make more sense than just reading in the order I wrote them.</p>
