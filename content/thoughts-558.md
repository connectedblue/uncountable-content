<p>. . . on the web, at least.</p>



<p>Of course, you&#8217;re very welcome to read my blog whenever and however you would like. But I&#8217;d prefer if you read my blog through an RSS app.</p>



<p>RSS is a pervasive, but little known, web technology that allows you aggregate all your content into one place for easy reading.  There are very few websites without an RSS feed, although many don&#8217;t advertise the link (or, even realise they have it).</p>



<p>When you put an RSS feed link into your RSS, it is called &#8220;subscribing&#8221;.  But don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it&#8217;s totally free, and you don&#8217;t give your email address.</p>



<p>The main benefits to you of reading in RSS are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> you can read your favourite sites ad free, with no algorithm.  Even if you subscribe to 200 sites, you have a single feed in your RSS app with all the different sites interleaved in date order, latest content first.</li>



<li>You don&#8217;t have to visit the website again if you don&#8217;t want.  No cookie pop ups, slow page loads or confusing menus.  But if you do want to take a look at the original site, it&#8217;s always just a click away in the RSS app.</li>



<li>You don&#8217;t have to remember to visit websites.  Sometimes an author may only make a post every six months.  When they do, it&#8217;ll pop into your feed.</li>



<li>You are free of social media scroll.  Everything in your feed is there because you want it to be.  If you no longer find a website interesting, you can remove it from your feed with a click and you&#8217;ll never see it again.</li>



<li>You are a free citizen of the web if you use RSS. You <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/own-your-scroll/" data-type="post" data-id="690">control your own flow</a>. You are no longer beholden to big tech platforms to have something interesting to read.</li>
</ul>



<p>The main benefit to me of you reading this blog through RSS is you are likely to read more. I don&#8217;t put my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/not-on-google/" data-type="post" data-id="515">site into search engines</a>, so however it was that you came across this post, there&#8217;s a good chance you won&#8217;t see it again.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve written a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1174">step by step guide to setting up RSS</a> to help you get started on your phone.</p>



<p>If you want to add my blog to your RSS app, you can find <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/rss-feed/" data-type="post" data-id="135">the instructions here</a>.</p>
