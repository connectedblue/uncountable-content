<p>Last session with Vicky this season at the playing field.  There were three of us from <a href="https://www.cucan.org.uk/Uley-trees-and-meadows">Uley Trees &amp; Meadows</a> gathered in the corner where we plan to restore wild flowers and grasses.  We had previously cut, raked and seeded a nearby patch <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2026/01/sowing-seeds-of-sport/" data-type="post" data-id="6874">a few weeks ago</a>.  </p>



<p>The far corner is covered with denser bramble, dock and long grass sward.  It&#8217;s difficult to know at this stage what might come up of interest, but we applied the usual technique of cutting low and raking off.  </p>



<p>I used the brush cutter to loosen the main material and we shifted the arisings on a tarpaulin to the side of the field.  It was bitterly cold to start with, and we either got used to it, or had warmed up by the time we finished at midday.</p>



<p>In the evening I went over to <a href="http://www.wottonareacan.org/">Wotton CAN</a> for an interesting film on the interplay between salmon migrations and beaver introduction.  There were two guests from Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and Avon Wildlife Trust who were able to answer questions and update on their beaver introduction projects.</p>



<p>Afterwards there was general networking and a chance to catch up with a couple of people I knew and met some others from Greening Tetbury who are useful contacts. </p>
