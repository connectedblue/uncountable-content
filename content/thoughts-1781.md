<p>Suppose you own Â£100,000 of Berkshire Hathaway stock, and that is your only investment asset.</p>



<p>Are you 100% invested in equities?</p>



<p>At time of writing, Berkshire holds about $280bn in cash and the total value of the company is $985bn.  In the end, a Berkshire dollar isn&#8217;t worth any more or any less than anyone else&#8217;s dollar.  </p>



<p>So your investment is at least 28.4% cash.  </p>



<p>But, it doesn&#8217;t stop there.  A significant portion of Berkshire&#8217;s non-cash portfolio is Apple stock.  They also have $62bn of cash but with a much greater valuation of $3.5tn &#8211; around 2%.  This ticks up the cash percentage in your Berkshire holding a bit more.</p>



<p>This is why you sometimes here the phrase &#8220;backing out the cash&#8221; when talking about company valuations.  The non-cash portion of the total company value is the true market view of the worth of the underlying enterprise operations.</p>



<p>Warren Buffett&#8217;s famous 20% average annual return since 1965 is going to be difficult to maintain going forward.  If the 30% cash side of Berkshire generates 5%, then the 70% investment side would have to grow by 27% to maintain an overall 20% annual return.</p>



<p>Of course, the counter argument is that this money is ready to deploy in an extremely profitable transaction when the time is right.  I just haven&#8217;t seen this for a while.</p>



<p>A sizeable chunk of my portfolio is Berkshire via my holding of S&amp;P500 index funds. I watch their moves with interest.</p>
