<p>It&#8217;s only been a few days, but I feel this blog is already forming into a shape that fits my mind.</p>



<p>Keeping a simple layout is forcing me to think carefully about how the content should be arranged.  And it boils down to this:-</p>



<p>Each page should do one thing well.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a start and end to each page.  No infinite scrolling.  Navigation between pages will be links which I&#8217;ll have to think carefully about.</p>



<p>So the blog as a whole should resemble a wiki as more pages are added .. cross referencing where necessary.</p>



<p>Almost every website starts with links to navigate the whole site. They are screaming &#8220;hey, here&#8217;s a load of other stuff before you read this stuff&#8221;.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to exhaust the reader. My navigation will be at the end, and they can choose to turn a page or not.</p>
