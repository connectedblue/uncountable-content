<p>It&#8217;s 1 August and the start of the <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/">Blaugust blogging challenge</a> which I have entered.  My aim is to post something during every day in August.  </p>



<p>The suggested first post this year is an introductory one, which is a great idea.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever done one of those before (apart from the About Me page I suppose).</p>



<p>My name is Chris and live in the Cotswolds, UK.  I stopped work in 2019, aged 51, and I now spend my time on 5-6 nature recovery projects around the local area.  I also have three community projects which I run:  The local walking festival, a monthly green drinks session and the Code Club for 8-11 year olds in the library after school.</p>



<p>I have two blogs, this one for general writing and <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a> where I write up the various activities I get involved with.</p>



<p>My career lasted 29 years, mostly in the telecommunications and IT sector.  Probably doesn&#8217;t seem so long to most people, although to me it seemed quite long and varied.  But I don&#8217;t miss it at all.  I&#8217;m now embarking on what I hope will be my second 29 year career dedicated to community and environment.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t really have a theme for writing &#8211; anything that comes into my head mostly.  However, I do write a large number of articles on <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/">how I manage money</a>, if that is your thing.</p>



<p>I follow a large number of blogs and quite like making reply posts.  Next week, I&#8217;ll be doing a week of just those posts to celebrate the work of other bloggers.  One thing I&#8217;m looking forward to in Blaugust is to do this with some of the other bloggers taking part.</p>



<p></p>
