<p>I sat down this evening to write up <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/04/planting-a-small-island/">my pond adventure today</a>, when I noticed that this was the 500th entry in the diary.</p>



<p>This feels like a bit of a milestone.  I started keeping a regular diary in 2023, and I&#8217;ve not missed a day of significant activity (there were also plenty of other days where nothing major happened, which I also enjoy very much).</p>



<p>The main reason for starting a diary was to make sense of all the things I do and not let them somehow all blend into one forgettable mass. Writing up a day at the point it happens allows you to include details that become important in the future.</p>



<p>I found a great way to surface that previous content too.  At the end of every post are some entry summaries for that same week, but in a previous year.  This means that when I&#8217;m proof reading today&#8217;s entry, I can scroll down and see a few old posts that I had forgotten about in 2023, or 2024. </p>



<p>Because it&#8217;s week based, when I make my diary entries next week, I&#8217;ll be reminded of a whole different set of previous days.  </p>



<p>So, assuming I keep up the same pace of active lifestyle that I currently lead, I should be passing 1,000 entries sometime mid-2027.  </p>
