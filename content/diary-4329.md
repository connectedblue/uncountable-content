<p>Up early to do my regular fortnightly raft check for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  I normally do this on Mondays, but there was heavy rain over the weekend, so I left it one more day to collect signs which might have washed away.</p>



<p>Otter signs on one, and the other was clear so nothing out of the ordinary to report.  It seems as if the mink we detected a couple of weeks ago hasn&#8217;t returned.  </p>



<p>I made it back home in good time for a <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a> call mid morning.  This is a quarterly meeting organised by the Town Council to promote the town for visitors and trade.  It was super productive, with a lot of information exchanged in the two hours.  I demonstrated an initial Events plugin for the new version of the website which was well received.</p>



<p>I need to aim to get the initial site functionality up and running by the end of March.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I had the second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> of the week, with eleven children again.  Somehow the booking has gone really astray this term, but I was able to accommodate everyone.  They are still talking about <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/02/visiting-stroud-lab/" data-type="post" data-id="4314">last week&#8217;s visit to the Stroud Lab</a>, so that&#8217;s a bonus.</p>
