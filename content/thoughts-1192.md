<p>Just upgraded my 2015 Dell laptop to Linux Mint 22.  Took about half an hour and went very smoothly.  Supported until 2029, by which time the laptop will be probably on it&#8217;s last lap.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s really no need to ditch relatively new hardware just because windows decides it no longer wants to run.  This one has 8Gb RAM and 6.2Gb is free when the system first boots up.  And every application I use is blazingly fast.</p>
