<p>I finally obtained my post history from LinkedIn after <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/returning-to-linkedin/" data-type="post" data-id="627">returning there recently</a>. It took a few goes with the support team, but I finally received the zip (the automated process didn&#8217;t work for me, possibly because my account had been frozen so long).</p>



<p>I have over 700 posts starting in 2009, although most were 2018-2022.  This was me blogging, before I got my own blogging platform.  So I will import them here so my digital history is as complete as possible.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still awaiting to see if they can retrieve my comment history.  I&#8217;m not so sure how important that really is, since they will be just out of context statements.  But, I have a couple of ideas that I might play around with, should they ever arrive.</p>



<p>I did also receive my DM history, but of course, that is not for publishing.</p>



<p>This is all part of my longer term project to have my writing be available <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">for reading in 200 years time</a>.  It&#8217;ll be a relief to freeze my LinkedIn account shortly which will free up time to work on more important things.</p>
