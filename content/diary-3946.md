<p>The weather this week so far is not very good, and only forecast to get worse.  I normally check the river rafts for <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> on a Monday, but I delayed it until today and managed to catch a break in the rain this morning.</p>



<p>Otter signs on one, and possible water vole droppings, although no prints recorded.  I&#8217;ll keep an eye on whether water voles might return &#8211; they are sporadically seen in this part of the river but it&#8217;s not a great population.</p>



<p>In the afternoon I held another <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  Getting close to the end of term now, and great progress made by the regulars on their projects.  I can&#8217;t seem to get the python training environment working on the Raspberry Pi website, so I&#8217;ll have to think a new strategy for that in the new year.</p>



<p>Some Christmas projects from the Scratch coders this week &#8211; involves finding christmas images on the web and uploading them into scratch and coding a story with them.</p>
