<p>It&#8217;s often assumed that gaming is the gateway drug to becoming interested in technology, but Lou <a href="https://louplummer.lol/confessions-of-a-non-gamer/">confesses to not being a gamer</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--21">
<p>I don&#8217;t look down on gamers or gaming in any way. The networks engineers I work with, all of whom I respect for their giant brains, all play computer games. I&#8217;ve always been kind of jealous that this whole segment of society, the people who should be in my tribe for our love of technology, have a love and a passion for something that just totally mystifies me. I&#8217;m almost 60 and I know their are gamers older than me. I&#8217;ve seen some of them on YouTube. I just feel like that if the urge to play hasn&#8217;t grabbed me by now that it never will. I miss not being able to talk to people about something so many find pleasure in, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in pretty much the same age bracket, having programmed my first computer in 1981 (a 1K sinclair zx81).  From that moment on I was hooked.  The process of creating a new program is what enthralled me, not using an application someone else had written (game or not).</p>



<p>Even then, there were games for the zx81 &#8211; it was a huge market and people acquired the computers solely for playing, not writing BASIC programs (let alone machine code.  As an aside, my first ever computer book was <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/2000236/Book/Mastering_Machine_Code_on_Your_ZX81_or_ZX80">Mastering Machine code on your ZX81</a>.  It still sits on my shelf today).</p>



<p>The whole gaming thing mystifies me too.  Very occasionally, someone will thrust a controller into my hands and I&#8217;ll jerk the character until it spins upside down or gets killed.  Of course, I admire the exponential growth in hardware and software techniques that brought us from the zx81 to playstation 5.  I just can&#8217;t motivate myself enough to participate.</p>



<p>I run an after school Code Club in the local library after school for the 8-11 year olds.  My main objective is to get them to explore digital creativity and get the computer to do what&#8217;s in their head rather than just passively using it.  Of course, I have the constant battle to keep them off the javascript games sites.  I count it as a major win if they create for 35 minutes before succumbing to the games.</p>
