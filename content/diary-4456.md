<p>I spend a lot of time outdoors, and also organise or lead a number of events in the community, so getting a first aid qualification has been on my to do list for a while.   I&#8217;ve done basic training before, but Stroud District Council were offering a two day, assessed course on Level 3 Outdoor First Aid.</p>



<p>There were 12 of us from a pretty diverse group around the area (including my friend Martin from <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/projects/wild-acres/" data-type="category" data-id="4">Wild Acres</a> who I didn&#8217;t know was booked on also).  It&#8217;s a long day &#8211; 9am to 6pm and packed with an extraordinary amount of information and practical exercises.</p>



<p>The instructor Martin from <a href="https://www.borderlandsfirstaid.co.uk/">Borderlands First Aid</a> was very knowledgeable and paced it about right to get us through the day. A lot of today&#8217;s session was vital signs and primary assessment, and treatments for the most urgent situations. This included CPR and defibrillator, which I&#8217;ve done before, but feel more confident now.</p>



<p>The last part of today was scenarios which were really good.  In teams of three, we took the role of casualty, first aider and &#8220;helpful/unhelpful bystander&#8221;.  These really helped to cement some of the concepts and it&#8217;s easy to forget the procedure even in a training setting, so good practice for the stress of the real thing.</p>



<p>Next friday is day two, and then hopefully a qualification will follow at the end of the day.  </p>



<p>I thoroughly recommend everyone and anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, potentially with hazardous equipment, to listen out for opportunities to get on this course.</p>
