<p>I&#8217;m part of the <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor online community</a> which is a great place to hang out with like-minded individuals and share knowledge about money.</p>



<p>I recently asked a poll question about mistakes community members have made themselves during their investment journey. The results and discussion were interesting, and serve as an authentic snapshot of the perils of being a retail investor.</p>



<p>First up, the poll itself. The question posed was &#8220;My biggest flaw as a retail investor is &#8230;&#8221; and the answer distribution was:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>contributing too little (25%)</li>



<li>trading too frequently (25%)</li>



<li>buying high, selling low (22%)</li>



<li>paying excessive fees (12%)</li>



<li>investing in fads (17%)</li>
</ul>



<p>This alone is interesting.  The first one should be within everyone&#8217;s scope to correct.  Providing that you consume less than you earn, you can always increase the amount going into your portfolio.  Regular contribution is <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="228">the most important factor</a> in wealth accumulation.</p>



<p>The second point is temperament.  Just get your hands away from the wheel.  Stop fiddling around with your portfolio &#8211; it&#8217;s really detrimental to your financial outcomes.</p>



<p>There was also a lively discussion underneath the poll, which raised other factors that people admitted to as their biggest flaw.  These were:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Not selling and re-investing in declining stocks.</li>



<li>Not sticking to a strategy</li>



<li>Not selling when the original premise for buying no longer holds</li>



<li>Sitting on cash too long</li>



<li>Selling winners too quickly</li>



<li>Using an IFA to manage the portfolio &#8211; fees eating into rewards</li>



<li>Not being decisive</li>



<li>Trying to beat the market</li>
</ul>



<p>This is also a great list.  Especially that last point.  In a seperate post, I asked if there was any active investor in the community who has a 20+ year track record of beating the market.  So far, no-one has stepped forward.  The general consensus from the comments to that post was that such a person is very unlikely to exist.</p>



<p>You could erase all the bullet points above and in the poll (except for the first) by simply being a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/choosing-a-passive-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="838">passive index fund</a> investor.</p>



<p>Most people believe they can beat the market though, especially inexperienced investors.  No amount of research showing 80% of professional active fund managers underperform the market in the long term will change anyone&#8217;s mind.  </p>



<p>If you are intent on beating the market though, it might be a good idea to have a plan in advance for how you will avoid all the points above that have bitten people in the past. Your financial outcomes will be improved if you do.</p>

<p>If you are an active investor with a 20+ year track record of beating the market, I&#8217;d love to interview you for the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/people-and-money/">People &amp; Money</a> series.
