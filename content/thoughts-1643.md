<p>A report from <a href="https://www.diyinvestor.net/pension-apathy-week-10-of-british-workers-dont-plan-to-retire/">Barnett Waddingham</a> makes sobering reading on the state of pension planning in the UK.</p>



<p>Money is probably our last remaining taboo subject in general, with pensions in particular being pushed to the back of mind.  But the reasons cited in the report for doing so are hopelessly naive.</p>



<p>10% of workers don&#8217;t expect to retire and 20% believe they won&#8217;t live long enough.  I&#8217;m not sure where this kind of deep self belief in your own mortality comes from, but I know it&#8217;s widespread (my own mother has been predicting her immiment demise since the age of 60, but is still healthy at age 83).</p>



<p>The reality is, that if you are a male or female aged 30 in the UK, the chances of you reaching 70 are well over a coin flip.  Unless you have specific information about your own health or lifestyle, the chances are you will in fact reach older age.  If you are unprepared financially for that, it will be tougher than if you had.</p>



<p>Similarly, it&#8217;s not realistic that you will be working until the day you drop.  Yes, there are stories of individuals who are working into their 90s and beyond, but they are the exceptions.  Society is not configured to offer employment to 10% of over 80s.</p>



<p>The harsh reality is that no matter how good you are at your job today, at some point in the future, someone somewhere will come along who can do it quicker, better and cheaper than you. You truly are expendable.</p>



<p>The good news however, is that it is entirely possible to plan a different path for your future self.  If you consume less than you earn, then you are definitely in a position to shape your future for better outcomes.  </p>



<p>The critical thing you will need is information.  It&#8217;s a non-trivial matter to build sufficient funds for the future, but it is possible and probably simpler than you might imagine at first.  There is a free set of resources and information at the <a href="https://pensionawarenessday.com/">Pension Awareness Week</a> website which will get you started and help review where you currently are.</p>



<p>Think of it as a gift to your future self.</p>
