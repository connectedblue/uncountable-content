<p>The 2025 programme for the <a href="https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk">Stroud Wildlife Survey Group</a> is now published and we kicked the season off today with an evening nature walk around Box Wood and Stuart Fawkes grassland.</p>



<p>I organised the route and logistics, but Jen was leading the wildlife side.  There were 13 members who turned out in the warm evening sun, and we really just took an informal amble through the woods, with plenty of stops and lots of things identified.</p>



<p>The most stunning thing on first entering the woods was the snow carpet of wild garlic &#8211; this wasn&#8217;t out at all when I was there <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/04/stepping-into-box-wood/" data-type="post" data-id="5895">two weeks ago for the recce</a>.</p>



<p>We started with the birdsong and noted Robin, Blackbird, Common Chiffchaff, Blackcap, Wren, Song Thrush, Great Tit and Greenfinch.</p>



<p>There were many woodland plants identified, including a very species rich part of open canopy near the disused quarry.   <br><br>We finished by 8.30pm, when it was just starting to go dark.  A really great start to the survey season.</p>
