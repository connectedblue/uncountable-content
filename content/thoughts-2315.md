<p>I run <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> , an after school club in Dursley Library which aims to inspire digital creativity and exploration in children 8-13.  There is so much that happens, I thought it would be a good idea to record a summary of how the club progressed and what will be tried in future sessions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">New equipment</h3>



<p>The major addition to the club this term was some new equipment purchased with grant funds last year.  It was delivered over Christmas and I spent a few days at the beginning of the year configuring it.  </p>



<p>It comprised 6 chromebooks, 3 raspberry pi and 2 wacom drawing tablets.  I store it on a trolley and children can take what they want to use in that session, or use the library PC.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been an amazing success.  The chromebooks mean that all kinds of software can be installed such as minecraft, unity and roblox coding environments.  This just isn&#8217;t possible on the library computers.  In addition, it gives them experience on how Linux works (the main operating system used developing for software applications and systems).</p>



<p>The chromebooks provide a secure and safe way to experiment with downloading and installing software.  Everything is in &#8220;containers&#8221;, and if something gets messed up, I can just delete the container and start again.</p>



<p>If any parent wishes to buy a computer for their child, I highly recommend chromebooks.  They are cheap, secure, highly functional and compatible with the google education accounts used at secondary schools for homework and curriculum delivery.  </p>



<p>The model we use at the club is the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Slim-Chromebook-Laptop/dp/B0C9M2MMZJ/">Lenovo IdeaPad 3</a> which is currently Â£233 from Amazon.  They are supported for 10 years by Google, which should be long enough to cover  their remaining years of education.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Digital drawing and artwork</h3>



<p>The wacom tablets have also been enormously popular.  These connect to the chromebooks and allow precise drawing with the pen.  Amazing stand alone artwork has been made, along with hand drawn characters used in scratch code.</p>



<p>Another very interesting use has been to run a youtube drawing tutorial on the laptop while following along on the tablet, pausing to draw.  This methodology was discovered entirely by the children &#8211; another great example of just providing tools and letting them discover how to use them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI</h3>



<p>We continue to make extensive use of AI using the code club account.  AI is going to be a pervasive and persistent feature of their working lives, regardless of what profession they enter.</p>



<p>So gaining experience in utilising AI to accomplish tasks is a vital skill to give you an edge over your peers. Indeed, it&#8217;s my belief that many &#8220;entry level&#8221; jobs today will already be fully automated in ten years time. So entering the workforce will require an immediate ability to work with AI assistants to produce higher level, value-added outputs from day one.</p>



<p>The children are using AI in extremely creative and novel ways to accomplish what they want their code to do.  Typically this journey might start something like &#8220;give me code to play minecraft&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t reveal anything very much at all.  However, they then break down the problem into smaller pieces which the AI can produce working framework code for, which they then modify.  They then assemble pieces together to make a working code.</p>



<p>Each week I&#8217;m open mouthed at how they use the tools.  I give very little intervention, and they ask the AI to do particular tasks.  One boy produced a fantasy adventure game with different scenes generated depending on text prompts.  Two other boys worked together on a racing car game that runs in a web browser.  Yet another used AI to suggest how their website could be made more modern looking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Websites</h3>



<p>We use the neocities platform to create websites.  This is just about as &#8220;bare metal&#8221; as you can get.  The pages have to be hand coded from scratch in HTML and CSS (something that doesn&#8217;t really happen in the real world).  </p>



<p>Despite this, every child dives in so enthusiastically to their website construction.  They research content, images and videos to include and experiment with basic layout and design.  We&#8217;ve had sites on gymnastics, wildlife, football and fitness.  We respect copyright and only include material which has explicit consent for inclusion in websites.</p>



<p>In this world of toxic social media and platforms which primarily serve the interests of billionaires, expressing yourself on your own website is a unique and valuable way to assert your digital independence online.  I make sure though that no personal details or anything that reveals identity or location are on the pages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">General skills</h3>



<p>The casual observer (or indeed, parent) may look at the output of the code and not be terribly impressed by what they see.  But this overlooks what is actually going on underneath and the depth of skills developed.</p>



<p>For starters, they all turn up on time, after a day of school, and put in another hour long session of self learning of an extremely hard topic.</p>



<p>They also help and inspire each other with projects.  This cements their learning and enhances collaboration skills.</p>



<p>But the process of coming up with an idea and then making the computer do it is the heart of the experience.  The steps needed to research, test, evaluate and try new ideas are repeated over and over. This cements their knowledge and skills into layers that can be built upon for ever more elaborate projects.</p>



<p>So my approach to the club is to enable &#8220;Unstructured Exploration&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve observed that children engage and progress in a completely non-linear fashion.  So there&#8217;s some gentle nudging and encouragement from me, but otherwise they set their own agenda.</p>



<p>One great example is using the browser to change the logo on their school website to a potato. To the untrained eye, this might seem pointless (if you do think this, I invite you to try this on your laptop and see how you get on). But doing this reveals great insights into how websites are made. And, for the record, no school websites are harmed in this exercise &#8211; after a page refresh the potato goes away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trip to Stroud</h3>



<p>In the February half term, we did a coach trip to Stroud to use the innovation lab in the library there.  I documented this day in <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/02/visiting-stroud-lab/">my online diary</a> if you want to read more detail.  Sadly places were limited so couldn&#8217;t be offered to everyone in the club, but I hope to run these again in future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead</h3>



<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the summer term to start up again and see what they create next.  One change I might bring in is to start using Wix as a website builder tool &#8211; this will allow them to focus more on content than coding the underlying pages.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also talking to Renishaw to see if they can host a trip in their STEM lab during the half term.  </p>



<p>Lots to look forward to.</p>
