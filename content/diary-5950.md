<p>The final day for the <a href="/series/fromebridge-pond/">pond planting project</a> at the Fromebridge reserve with the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  It&#8217;s taken most of April, and been a huge volunteer effort, but the results are already starting to show.</p>



<p>The smaller pond was completed a couple of weeks ago, and has been left undisturbed.  The planted vegetation has shot up already, giving a glimpse as to what this habitat might look like in a few months.</p>



<p>We focused today on filling in gaps around the big pond.  We spent the first 15 minutes walking with Pete and identifying which were the main areas of focus.  The technique was the same &#8211; to dig into the silt piles on the bank and retrieve plants buried underneath.  </p>



<p>It proved a bit harder today, firstly because the baking heat of the last week made the silt harden.  But also because a lot of the plants have been recovered already.  We still found enough though to get a good number planted out.</p>



<p>The pond level was very low, but the good news is that the leak has been identified.  This will be fixed next week, and the pond filled back to the required level.</p>



<p>At break, we had delicious cake from Susie and wild garlic scones from Caroline.  These tasted amazing, so will try baking some myself.</p>
