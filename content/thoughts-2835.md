<p>In early trading on 2 January 2025, the FTSE100 passed the 10,000 mark for the first time.  </p>



<p>Of course, the absolute value of an index has no meaning, and neither does a movement over the course of a day. But naturally, a number like 10,000 invokes an emotional reaction. So predictably, the moment was mentioned on the lunchtime news.</p>



<p>(on a side note, I remember when the stock market index was reported every night on the news. This hasn&#8217;t happened for quite some years. It&#8217;s a pity because we are woefully under invested in the UK, so even just mentioning it every day would raise awareness).</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been invested in the FTSE100 via index funds for a long time &#8211; I think my first purchase was through Scottish Widows in 1999 or 2000.  Today it represents <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/us-and-uk-portfolio-allocation/" data-type="post" data-id="1878">around 60% of my invested portfolio</a>.</p>



<p>So today&#8217;s milestone is a good time to review my experience of the FTSE100 as a key pillar in building financial independence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Strong 2025</h3>



<p>I haven&#8217;t looked at all the historic data, but 2025 must be the strongest single year performance on record. On 1 Jan 2025 a unit in the L&amp;G accumulating FTSE100 tracker was £3.189 and a year later £4.003.</p>



<p>This is a rise of 25.5% on a total return basis. You must remember to not only look at the increase in the index itself because FTSE100 companies also pay significant dividends. These are not included in the raw index value. Dividends are a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/dividend-is-not-income/" data-type="post" data-id="1815">return of capital, not income</a> (a fact which frequently invokes both anger and denial among a significant fraction of investors). So you need to re-invest the dividend to achieve the total return of the index. This is most easily done by buying the ACC (accumulating) version of the index tracker fund.</p>



<p>This return is all the more remarkable because there are no tech or AI stocks in the FTSE100.  They are mostly utility type companies such as banks, insurance, food, mining, communication and energy.  The index has suffered from a lack of global recognition since the financial crisis, but 2025 seemed to be the year when capital started flowing in from international investors looking to diversify away from US tech stocks.</p>



<p>So while we may never see this kind of annual return again, the long talked-about AI bubble should not have too much long term impact if it bursts in the next couple of years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Long term returns</h3>



<p>I keep extensive records of ISA contributions over the last 25 years which gives a reasonable view of the medium term performance.</p>



<p>From 2002/03 to 2012/13 tax years, I contributed into the L&amp;G100 tracker, and haven&#8217;t sold a single unit since. So it makes a nice petri dish to examine both absolute and relative performance.</p>



<p>As of 1 January 2026, this fund breaks down as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Percentage of fund value on 1 Jan 2026</td></tr><tr><td>11 years Contributions</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">28%</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation return</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">25.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Real return</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">46.5%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So 72% of the holding represents the total return on contribution to date.  This equates to 257%. However, it&#8217;s important to take account of inflation to get a real return.</p>



<p>I used to make just one contribution each year around March. So RPI needs to be added to bring that year&#8217;s contribution up to today&#8217;s value. This means 91% of that total return is just keeping all the contributions in line with inflation.</p>



<p>Netting this off makes the real return 166%. This represents an average gross annual return of 7.4%, or 5.7% real return.</p>



<p>Note that +5.7%pa real return over RPI is not really <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/setting-investment-objectives/" data-type="post" data-id="1455">a realistic investment objective</a>. The enormous return from 2025, coupled with the low inflation that year has skewed this figure. A figure of between +3-4% above RPI is a much more likely assumption for the FTSE100 over the long term.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The next 20 years</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m currently <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/practical-methods-for-draining-the-sipp/" data-type="post" data-id="2682">six years into drawdown</a>, and my strategy has been to withdraw from the FTSE100 side and leave the S&amp;P investments for the year 2040 and beyond.  </p>



<p>I like to keep <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">4 years of expenses in cash</a> to protect against market volatility. I don&#8217;t <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/why-i-dont-invest-in-bonds/" data-type="post" data-id="1608">hold bonds</a>, but in a weird way think of the FTSE100 as a &#8220;bond substitute&#8221;. The utility nature of the constituents means that it&#8217;s neither going to the moon, nor will it crash to the floor.</p>



<p>2025 was a one-off correction in my view.  It brings London a little bit back into global thinking, but it will fall back to the longer term 7-8%pa gross return over the next couple of decades.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always been a long term buy and hold investor and that&#8217;s the way I&#8217;ll stay.</p>
