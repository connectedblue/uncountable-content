<p>I recently <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/horse-transport-supply-chain/" data-type="post" data-id="2152">wrote a post</a> that consisted of a short introduction by me, followed by AI generated content on a particular topic. I realise that this will be considered controversial with a lot of people, so it&#8217;s useful to set out where, when and why I might incorporate AI content into this blog.</p>



<p>I have also put some guard rails in place to protect readers from unintentionally stumbling upon it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why use AI at all?</h3>



<p>I write this blog solely for my own amusement.  There are many different parts to it, organised by topics of interest to myself.  That said, I&#8217;m aware that other people access some of the content through RSS and by visiting the website directly, so I feel a responsibility to not cause harm to them or the wider world.</p>



<p>Like others, I use AI to get overviews on particular topics.  These are almost always ephemeral.  After the output has generated, I either forget or subliminally absorb the information.  But sometimes, I feel like I want the information to be more readily reference-able.  </p>



<p>The topic that kicked this all off was the use of grasslands in the supply chain when <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/horse-transport-supply-chain/" data-type="post" data-id="2152">horses were the predominant form of transport</a>.  Grassland restoration is something I&#8217;m passionate about, but I&#8217;m not going to research every snippet of interesting background information.  Prior to running this AI query, my knowledge in this area was very scant.  I wanted to know more, but didn&#8217;t really want to spend a few hours browsing websites looking for more information.</p>



<p>So I obtained that summary from AI.  I don&#8217;t attach any importance or accuracy any higher than if a guy down the pub told me all this.  However, as a framework it seems to make sense with what I understand already about the evolution of land use in this country.</p>



<p>I chose to store the output on my blog so I can reference it again in the future.  This probably seems weird (why don&#8217;t I just run the query again) but it&#8217;s a simple solution to note taking.  I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised if I did it again in the future.  </p>



<p>I therefore have put together a policy to follow if I use AI again in the future.  Hopefully this enables full transparency and dispels any notion that I&#8217;m wilfully polluting the internet with AI slop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How I use AI</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>All posts will begin with an introduction created by myself.  An AI Content Warning will appear before any AI generated content.</li>



<li>At the end of the article, there&#8217;ll be a section on AI methodology which will summarise the inference inputs and models used.</li>



<li>AI output may be edited for flow or continuity, or just to remove any fluff that is not relevant to the topic.</li>



<li>The post will be tagged with AI-assisted, and all AI content can then be viewed at <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/ai-assisted/">https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/ai-assisted/</a>.</li>



<li>Posts with AI content will be excluded from the main RSS feed</li>
</ul>



<p>We are only at the beginning with AI, and I am excited by it&#8217;s potential.  I will continue to use it for inspiration and creativity where applicable.  But I will be very intentional about that and tread carefully when publishing here.</p>
