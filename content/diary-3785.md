<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Another lovely day.  Went down to Queenstown to book an all day jet boating and kayaking tour for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Came back to the cottage for lunch and decided to walk the tobin track up to the top of the ridge above arrowtown.  We almost got to the top but we were afraid we were getting sunburnt so came back down again and cooled off in the cottage.</p>
<p>In the evening we had some chips and went to see The Kings Speech at the local cinema.  Unfortunately, you have to book as the cinema is so small, so we went for a riverside walk instead.</div>
