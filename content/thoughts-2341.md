<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member Hop1, who has been investing for a very long time and well on track for early retirement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you …</h3>



<p>UK based 55 year old chartered engineer in the energy sector. Commenced employment in an engineering apprenticeship then progressed to engineer with a distance learning engineering degree.</p>



<p>Energy industry role has taken me on international assignments either rotational (28 days on / 28 days off) or accompanied assignments with my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Married to a part time teacher (state education) with two children, one in their final year of university and the second currently in final year of school A levels, with no desire to attend university currently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>Was signed up to a pension, final salary as soon as my apprenticeship completed (age 21), was pressurised by the foreman in the company to ‘get it signed, you’ll not regret it’ and to be fair even though I left that company after 13 years it turns out he was right.</p>



<p>Through the advantages of working internationally additional cash was available and at around 38 years old we started investing in ISAs and started to take interest in my company DC pension, increasing the contributions when we could.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are your children following your lead with investing?</h3>



<p>We discuss it, though I see their eyes roll… we have set up ISAs, LISA, and SIPPs with ii using the family and friend feature for reduced fees, explaining the passive index tracking approach rather than the individual company approach and they drip feed a few pounds in a month. </p>



<p>Have also set up GIAs (Trading212) with a couple a hundred pounds for them to experiment with.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>My wife and I are both&nbsp; targeting a 58 yrs old retirement date with a focus to invest as much as we can in DC, SIPP, ISAs over the next 3 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We intend to fund some slow travel over the winter months for the first couple of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In accumulation pre-retirement phase currently with a target of moving to drawdown in circa three years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At what point did you realise that your approach would actually result in early retirement?</h3>



<p>When the eldest was showing University would be their route we (wife and I) started to focus on our finance status. This was around eight years ago. We pulled and overview document and xls together to understand what we had across DBs, DCs, ISAs, GIA etc. Then used that to really understand our position. </p>



<p>Once the position was known and understood we looked at what that means for the future and started to play with cash flow modelling tools. When I say we I actually mean me, my wife had little interest. I always use pessimistic assumptions for modelling, as being an engineer I live by safety margins and understanding them.</p>



<p>With the modeling I started to realise we had potential to seriously consider early retirement which we always discussed but never actually assessed if and when it would be possible. The power of cash flow modelling really unlocked the understanding for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>Have been a saver for as long as I can remember and do not like debt of any type. Worked and saved to pay off our mortgage by the age of 35 and have remained mortgage and debt free since then.</p>



<p>I think my dislike of debt stems back to my late teens when I took out HP on a video recorder / player which when I later assessed the total cost I was left feeling used by the company.</p>



<p>Prior to purchasing anything major I review and assess then hold off for a week or two to see if I still need / want it. I noticed both the children apply a similar approach to spending, which I’m not sure whether that&#8217;s a positive or not..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Being mortgage free while bringing up children is an impressive feat.&nbsp; How did you manage that?</h3>



<p>Both my wife and I worked, with her being a teacher in a local school (same village as we live) it eased the balance of working and bringing up children, particularly with school holidays. My job had overseas and offshore requirements where I would be paid an uplift to my salary for the location and being away from home for a number of weeks at a time. The additional money from these trips was paid off the mortgage every month for around 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being away was tough and put additional requirements on my wife, but I’d always done that type of&nbsp; work since we met and she could see the outcome of the mortgage coming down. The position we are in today has a lot to do with her managing this and being incredibly supportive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also decided not to ‘follow the Jone’s’ with bigger houses, we remained in the same size house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As highlighted earlier, I have a dislike of owing money, even mortgage, which in hindsight may have negatively impacted my investment Are you the person in your household who implements the investing journey?&nbsp; If so, wportfolio. </p>



<p>There are many studies that show investing is the most beneficial wealth builder rather than paying off a mortgage. However, the feeling when it&#8217;s paid off and knowing there is always a roof over the family&#8217;s head is worth that potential negative investment impact, for me anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What steps do you take to ensure your investing strategy can be continued if something were to happen to you?</h3>



<p>As mentioned above my wife shows minimal interest in the process but understands the overview and what it means. </p>



<p>Following Pete M (meaningful money) advice with regard to having a ‘WiD’ when I die document I outline the overarching intent in there but also after talking with my wife include guidance and recommendation on moving to a IFA to manage it going forward in the event of my death or becoming unable to manage the approach. </p>



<p>This is also shared with the children along with the LPAs in the event both of us are unable to manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the WiD I’ve included three recommendations of IFA to engage with after carrying out a review of providers.</p>



<p>As I age and dependent on how much interaction is required to manage the process I may consider handing over to an IFA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>Balanced / cautions. Have established a gilt ladder for 4 years for spend from the target retirement date.</p>



<p>Investments are in global index passive funds or managed global funds. Currently starting to build dividend paying funds into the portfolios to further diversify.</p>



<p>I uses II for my ISA, company DC is also global managed funds + 5% emerging markets + 10% global corporate bonds.</p>



<p>My wife uses iWeb for ISA with a similar approach global funds with a few corporate bonds. SIPP is lifestratergy 60 and work pension is DB (local council).&nbsp;</p>
