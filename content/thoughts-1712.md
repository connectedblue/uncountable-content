<p>A few months back, I started to think a bit more intentionally about writing this blog.  I wanted to improve the reader experience, by making <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/fine-tuning-post-display-in-wordpress/" data-type="post" data-id="1313">tweaks to the navigation</a>, and also by <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1156">scheduling posts</a> in a more predictable way.</p>



<p>When I started writing here, I did so only to record my own thoughts.  I had no idea that others would be reading.  But when I started receiving emails, guestbook entries and RSS feed queries, I started to think of this site more as a publication than a notebook.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fun to be an editor as well as a writer.  I had a backlog of content I could resurface.  I was also part of the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/first-post-of-blaugust-2024/" data-type="post" data-id="1231">blaugust</a> challenge, so over the summer I was writing as often as possible.  This continued into September, but all of a sudden, I&#8217;m looking at a pool of only three days of scheduled posts.</p>



<p>My first thought was to panic write something to fill a few days.  But, that of course is daft, and completely at odds with my desire to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-to-show-you-next/" data-type="post" data-id="1462">improve the reader experience</a>.</p>



<p>The editor part of my brain is bullying the writer part and that can only end in tears.</p>



<p>So there will not be a published post on 20 September 2024.  I will deliberately break my streak of about 60 days of sequential publishing.  But, after that, I will still stick to the pattern of publishing in the main feed at 6am each day UK time for the days I do post.  And optionally, a post at 6pm if I want a second post.  But no more than two.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ll continue to post <a href="/topic/quick-thoughts/">quick thoughts</a> and other posts <a href="/topic/not-in-main-feed/">not destined for the main feed</a>.</p>



<p>This change will hopefully keep my editor and writer desires in better balance.</p>
