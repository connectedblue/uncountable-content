<p>Sometimes everything seems to get scheduled on one day.  Appointments with various people and projects I&#8217;m involved with around Dursley filled up the whole day.</p>



<p>First port of call was Jacob&#8217;s House to see Leah about setting up a social network sharing plugin on the <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a> site. Pretty straightforward &#8211; one year&#8217;s subscription and entering the key into the dashboard to check everything works. I&#8217;ll figure out at the weekend how best to use it.</p>



<p>At 10.30am, a wider group of people joined us to discuss the &#8220;26 things for 2026&#8221; campaign that we have funding for and will run through the year.  There&#8217;s not a lot of time left. so we needed an agreed plan and at least a list of the 26 things.</p>



<p>There was a lot of talent and ideas around the table so the discussion went in all sorts of directions, but we eventually landed on a simple list to build a campaign around.  Next challenge will be getting people to submit content on those topics.</p>



<p>Charlie was there who I needed to see next, so we went across to the Bank Cafe for a coffee.  She is running a creative initiative with the school next term to design a new game for the Escape Room.  I&#8217;d like to include a digital component for that by utilising the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  There were a couple of other things to catch up on, so we ended up a good hour there.  </p>



<p>Next stop was the Lego Robot challenge at <a href="https://rednockschool.org.uk/">Rednock School</a>.  The children are progressing very well with building the obstacles, and we pretty much completed them today.  They have a double period scheduled next week, so we&#8217;ll start work on the robot coding which will bring it all together.</p>



<p>By now it was getting dark, but still not finished.  Final meeting of the day was the Environmental Land Management Group back at Jacob&#8217;s House.  This is an infrequent group now, but important to catch up with various biodiversity initiatives in the town and wider area.  </p>
