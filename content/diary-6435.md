<p>A continuation task at the ocean reed bed today with <a href="https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/">Stroud Valleys Project</a>.  I last visited here a <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2023/11/down-in-the-reeds-again/" data-type="post" data-id="2681">couple of years ago where we removed bramble and willow</a> to improve the habitat.  </p>



<p>The site looked very dense with aquatic vegetation, so the maintenance tasks we carried out had a big effect. However, the willow had also shot up quite a lot too, so today we wanted to remove as much as possible from the bank side, without wading too much into the bed.</p>



<p>I started by venturing around 3m from the edge where the ground was still firm and there were tall willows that could be snipped out with the loppers.  It&#8217;s pretty pointless of course &#8211; willow will just grow back very quickly.  But we hope that by doing this we give a chance for the other vegetation to grow up around it.</p>



<p>About an hour in, I got a whiplash from a willow and sustained an eye injury so needed to take a break.  I should have been wearing safety goggles &#8211; perhaps this will be the wake up call to make sure they are always on.</p>



<p>One of the challenges of this site is the removal of arisings.  It&#8217;s a private residential site, so there isn&#8217;t a natural place to make a habitat pile.  So we had to pile great chunks of willow on the back of the truck which Pete periodically disposed of back to the site at Fromebridge.</p>



<p>By the end of the day we managed to clear a huge amount, which hopefully keeps it at bay for another couple of years.</p>
