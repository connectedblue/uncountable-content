<p>The festive season is coming to a close, and it&#8217;s good to have the regular activities restarting this week.  Today was the regular raft check for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.</p>



<p>I normally do three sites, but one is out of commission at the moment since the high waters overturned the raft.  Once it is safe to enter the water again, I&#8217;ll go down with Pete and fix it.  </p>



<p>The other two sites were quiet.  There was otter speint on one which is encouraging and footprints on both cartridges, although it wasn&#8217;t really possible to know if they were rat or water vole.</p>
