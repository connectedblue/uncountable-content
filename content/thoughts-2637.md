<p>I subscribe to over 1,000 <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1174">RSS feeds</a>. Sounds an awful lot, but does provide me with a high quality list of content to read every day.  I keep track of them all using FreshRSS, which has proved highly capable of scaling up, without being overwhelming.</p>



<p>Every six months or so, I notice that a number of feeds report errors, so do an investigation to fix and keep the list tidy, and avoid needlessly requesting new content from links that don&#8217;t work.</p>



<p>Sadly, a large number of failing feeds this time were from websites that are no longer available.  There&#8217;s both a cost and an effort to keep an independent blog alive, so I understand they can&#8217;t be maintained forever.  Still, I wonder whether they knew they had a (silent) RSS audience who would miss when they were gone?</p>



<p>There were a couple whose feed was broken in some way, so I dropped a quick note to the authors to draw their attention and see if it could be fixed.  Hopefully, I won&#8217;t need to do anything further and their content will flow again.</p>



<p>There were another handful who still had sites, but either the domain or feed address had changed.  This was a matter of adding their new feed and deleting the old one.</p>



<p>Finally there was a group of mostly small news sites whose feed still worked but they only provide summaries of articles rather than full feeds.  Given the volume of feeds I have, my preference is to only have full feeds.  I use a companion, self-hosted app called <a href="https://www.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/">Full-Text RSS</a> to convert summary feeds into full text feeds.  </p>



<p>However, some websites don&#8217;t like this and have recently blocked my IP from doing this extra step.  I don&#8217;t have an issue with this &#8211; they need to monetise by pulling visitors to their site.  So, although I enjoyed their content, I removed them from my feed list.</p>



<p>Feels good to have done this housekeeping which should be good for another six months or so.  I set my FreshRSS server to refresh content four times a day, so not sending out multiple needless queries to the internet reduces impact on the small servers out there.</p>
