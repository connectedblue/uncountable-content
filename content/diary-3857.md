<p>Trip up the Painswick valley today to seed a site with <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a>.  Luckily I planned to get there a bit early, because it seems after I passed through a junction at Edge, it was closed for tree work.  Lorna had to do a huge deviation via Painswick to get here.</p>



<p>The site was a beautiful valley location.  It was around 4ha and is currently grazed by sheep.  The preparation wasn&#8217;t ideal &#8211; the grass had been cut but not collected.  Harrowing had been done, but the loose grass covered a lot of bare earth.</p>



<p>There were five of us, and we were joined by the farmer&#8217;s family for the first hour so we were able to broadcast the seed by hand.  The second field was completed quite quickly, enabling us to concentrate on the main field.</p>



<p>Tom drove the Landrover with someone on the back, and I continued to spread by hand from a bucket.</p>



<p>The weather was absolutely stunning ... if you had this day in June you&#8217;d be happy.  So a nice location to sit and have lunch in the sun.  We completed the whole site by about 3.30pm.</p>
