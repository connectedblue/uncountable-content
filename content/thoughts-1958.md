<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member DavidUK who started investing in early 40s, but now has a solid plan in place to fund early retirement before aged 60. </p>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>I am 47 years old. I grew up in New Zealand and started my career as a Management Consultant. For the last 18 years I have been fortunate to work within London’s financial services sector. It’s been a tough gig but I have met some awesome people and learnt a lot about life and the world from them.</p>



<p>I have always had a prudent attitude to money &#8211; “Don’t spend what you don’t have and make sure you have some put away for a rainy day!”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, the best things in life are priceless and I have never cut back on travelling the world and making lifelong memories with my wife and children.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>I was a late starter to actively deciding where to invest my money. I only got into it about 5 years ago. It&#8217;s surely been a learning experience but the old adage of time in the market not timing the market has held true.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">As a &#8220;late starter&#8221;, do you trim back on lifestyle to put more into the pot, or are you trying to pick high growers to “catch up” lost time?</h3>



<p>Definitely trimming back on spending and prioritising my SIPP / ISA allowance is a major part of the catch up plan. I am also trying to supplement the ETFs with potential opportunities that may be 10x in 10 years. </p>



<p>My simple maths is that if £5K invested in a high growth opportunity surges over a 10 year period, it would result in saving me a full year of SIPP contributions. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>My key goal from money is to be able to quit the rat race and do the things I enjoy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?</h3>



<p>I am still in the accumulation phase. I want to retire as soon as my children finish university. I see myself retiring within the next 8 to 10 years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is retiring back to New Zealand an option you’re considering?</h3>



<p>Retiring back to New Zealand is not an option. Mainly because it&#8217;s too far away and my kids will most likely settle in the UK / Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I am seriously considering moving somewhere closer where the weather is warmer and cost of living is lower than the UK. </p>



<p>My two main considerations financially are: (a) are the inheritance tax rules more favourable than the UK for assets owned in that country and (b) will I get more value for my retirement money when compared to the cost of living in the UK.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>I have adopted a core and satellite approach to investing i.e. ETFs as my core with individual stocks as my satellites. My investing approach for stocks is to invest in companies where I understand the market or even better use their products. </p>



<p>I have a bias towards technology because I am fascinated by the level of intelligence and creativity that has come out of this sector over the last decade or so. We are only at the start of the next wave of innovation and there is a lot more to still come. </p>



<p>Most importantly, I avoid FOMO investing (lesson already learnt!)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What was your FOMO lesson?  </h3>



<p>Post-Covid Scottish Mortgage was soaring (backed by Tesla) and I piled into it near it&#8217;s all-time high. The stock then dropped overnight and I was badly burnt. SMT has not returned to those levels again but I managed to cut my losses and recover them in other investments.  </p>



<p>I am a lot more tempered now. If an opportunity sounds like a passing fad I stay away.&nbsp; Admittedly, I do have a big position in Microstrategy but I bought a majority of my stake before the price surged so will hold onto it long term.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What preparations are you, or will you put in place to encourage your children to start their investing journey earlier?</h3>



<p>It is a pity that schools and universities are not equipped to teach the younger generation the value of investing early to achieve financial freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My children both have ISAs and I encourage them to invest any money they receive for Christmas / Birthdays. They are both teenagers but understand how macro factors impact the financial markets and how to look out for the next emerging macro trend that will create an investment opportunity. </p>



<p>My hope is that they will take these lessons into their adult lives and be a lot further than me in their investing journey at my age.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?  </h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Financial Times &#8211; although I think their writers are falling behind the times on how the world is changing.</li>



<li>Google Finance News &#8211; my search history and watchlist helps narrow down the topics and news I am interested in.</li>



<li>Researching the investments made by Investment Trusts and popular investors on platforms such as Interactive Investor and Etoro and then picking the ones that appeal to me.  </li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I would love to hear about other people’s investing styles, especially what the next big macro trends would be in the next 3 to 5 years.&nbsp;</p>
