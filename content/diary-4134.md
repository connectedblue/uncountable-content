<p>Following the departure of Lorna last year, <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> are recruiting a new staff member to join the team and continue the grassland recovery project across the Cotswolds.  I was asked to help with part of the interview process, so headed over to <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/nature-reserves/greystones-farm">Greystones Farm</a> where they were being held all day.</p>



<p>The Glorious Grasslands project could not operate at all without a sizeable and committed volunteer force.  There is is only funding for three staff members.  Last year we harvested nearly 3,000kg of weed and restored around 115ha of new meadow.  So it&#8217;s great that the volunteer perspective forms part of the selection process for new staff.</p>



<p>I was joined by Chris, another long time project member.  Between us we&#8217;ve experienced all aspects of field operations, and also have quite a few insights from other volunteers about their motivations for participating.</p>



<p>There were 5 excellent candidates. They had a one hour interview with the management team first, followed by a 20 minute chat with us about the harvesting process.  We had the equipment laid out behind the barn so it was a good talking point with the candidates.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s really uplifting to see quite how much talent there is in the wider ecology landscape.  It&#8217;s not the easiest of professions, but so many young people wanting to develop their careers in nature recovery.  Whoever is selected, the project will be in good hands.</p>



<p>After we gave our feedback, we left the management team to their deliberations.  Can&#8217;t wait to welcome the new person on a habitat management work party in the near future.</p>
