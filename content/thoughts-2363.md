<p>I spend quite a chunk of time online interacting with people through various small communities I&#8217;m a member of. Some I organise myself, but all reflect a subset of my varied interests.</p>



<p>During lockdown, when looking for things to do online, I idly asked on LinkedIn one day whether any artists wanted to get together and do an online expo of their work.  Overnight, I was bombarded by replies and so <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">The Artocalypse</a> was born.</p>



<p>I quickly cobbled together a discord server and sent instructions to those who were interested.  The energy and collaboration was instant between the artists.  They started to hang out, do art together, share work and experiences and prepare for the exhibitions ahead.  We held two ticketed events, over weekends in October and November 2020.  Each was attended by over 200 people, and on the second we even had live opera on the opening night!</p>



<p>But more importantly, friendships were formed and people began to see the power of global interaction through digital platforms.  We are still going strong today and currently have a <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2025-ember-and-ink/">poetry expo</a>, to which anyone can submit an entry.</p>



<p>A couple of years ago, I also set up another, very different, community in the town where I live.  This is <a href="https://dursleygreen.org.uk/">Dursley Green</a>, where people interested in the environment, sustainability and related issues can meet and network.  We hold a drinks event once a month, but found that we needed an online place where we could leave information and dive into topics a bit deeper.  So, I created an online hub, which is very low traffic, but an important place for people to leave information.</p>



<p>For this hub, I found a very nice forum software called <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a> which was very simple to install and configure, and has pretty much sat there doing it&#8217;s job with practically zero maintenance from me.</p>



<p>Another engaging community I joined recently is the <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor community</a>, exclusively open to people who use that investing platform.  This is a great place to connect with like-minded people and get inspiration and information on different ways to improve financial outcomes.</p>



<p>But in addition to the app, I have created a &#8220;community within a community&#8221; by hosting a fortnightly Zoom call on retirement with a subset of members.  This usually has around 20 people on it &#8211; some regulars and some new each time.  This is another example of a small web community created out of thin air with just some standard tools.</p>



<p>And last, but certainly not least, there is the blogging community on the Indie Web which is very small and connected by dozens of invisible wires.  I&#8217;ve only been writing this blog for a year, but I have taken part in challenges, carnivals, reply posts and Zoom calls.  I leave entries in guestbooks, send emails to other bloggers and occasionally receive emails from readers.  </p>



<p>These <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/human-protocols/" data-type="post" data-id="497">human protocols</a> emerge organically to create a welcoming and engaging community that is not hosted on a central platform.  It&#8217;s remarkable that it exists.</p>



<p>So I was excited a year ago to see a blog carnival host spot available for May 2025.  I signed up without hesitation, and look forward to reading what this incredible small web community creates.</p>

<p>This post is my submission for the May 2025 <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb Blog Carnival</a>, hosted this month by <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-small-web-communities/">me</a>! If you have a blog, why not <a href="/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-small-web-communities/">make a post</a> on this topic and join in?</p>



<p>I look forward to reading your thoughts on this topic.</p>
