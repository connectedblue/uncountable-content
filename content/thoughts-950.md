<p>I don&#8217;t identify as an artist, but I do identify as a creative.</p>



<p>My digital art journey began in 2020, just after the first covid lockdown was announced in March 2020.  Like everyone else, I was stuck at home, but unlike everyone else, I had stopped work a few months before, so I needed something to focus my time on.</p>



<p>I chose poetry collaboration.  I had been experimenting with video editing software, and wanted a project to practice my skills on.  So I put a call on LinkedIn to see if anyone wanted to contribute to a group poem where individuals read one line each and I splice them together into a full piece.</p>



<p>And so the LinkedIn poet&#8217;s society was born.</p>



<p>The first video was the Desiderata by Max Ehrmann.  You can <a href="https://youtu.be/iz2MHzQYPCo">watch it on youtube here</a>.  People from all over the world contributed, and the one common thing we had was lockdown and all the uncertainty April 2020 was revealing to the world.</p>



<p>The second video was If&#8230; by Rudyard Kipling.  The nice twist on this one was that all the speakers said &#8220;you&#8217;ll be a man, my son&#8221; to a photo of themselves as a baby.  You can <a href="https://youtu.be/r2nMbRHbYLI">watch that video here</a>.</p>



<p>The editing and sound quality on both is pretty shocking, but the community and togetherness felt by everyone during those lockdown months was the important thing.  </p>



<p>A few months later, in August 2020, I put out another LinkedIn post calling for artists who wanted to exhibit in an online art exhibition, given that all the galleries had closed due to covid.</p>



<p>The response was overwhelming.  We set up a group called The Artocalypse on discord and set about planning the exhibition.  The software I was using had exhibition booths which could display google slides.  There was also a video room where visitors and artists could meet.  We named it the Art and Soul Cafe.</p>



<p>The artists did an amazing job.  We did the first exhibition in October 2020 and had 200 people attend the ticketed event over the weekend.  Unfortunately the event page has now been archived, but we will create a page in the new artocalypse site to recreate the exhibits from that first expo.</p>



<p>We followed up with another expo in November 2020.  This time it was an online christmas market combined with art exhibition and visitors could view the art and visit booths with live traders displaying their wares over video.</p>



<p>It was a crazy, fun and creative time.  We even had a live opera event on the opening night. So many different artists took part &#8211; music, visual, poets, puppetry.  </p>



<p>After life started to return to normal, the Artocalypse discord got quieter and we didn&#8217;t hold any more events.  However, the idea was still kicked around between Kimberly (the other co-founder) and I.  So I&#8217;m happy to announce that <a href="https://artocalypse.org/">the Artocalypse has a web presence again</a>, and is running expos, a discord server and challenges for artists.</p>



<p>These days I mostly focus on writing.  I keep a <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">diary of all the conservation</a> and other activities I do in my local area.  And I have this blog, which is a blank canvas for me to write about whatever I choose.</p>



<p>So, to close, my digital art journey has been short, exhilarating and insanely creative.  I have no idea where it will head next.</p>
