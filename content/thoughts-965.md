<p>I often write about money and my financial journey, but it may not always make sense, especially for those new to investing.</p>



<p>So starting tomorrow, 22 July, I will publish a daily article from Monday to Friday on some of the principles I have formulated over the years.  The topics I will cover are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Mon:  </strong>Why accumulate wealth?</li>



<li><strong>Tue:  </strong> What is Financial Independence?</li>



<li><strong>Wed:</strong> Most important factors for accumulating wealth</li>



<li><strong>Thu:</strong> Saving vs Investing</li>



<li><strong>Fri:</strong> What is risk?</li>
</ul>



<p>I hope you enjoy this journey through some investing ideas, and it inspires you to consider the principles you like to follow when making long term financial decisions.</p>



<p>I may do future weeks covering other money topics if there is demand.  Drop me an email to <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a> if you have feedback.</p>
