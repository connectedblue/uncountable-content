<p>There&#8217;s not a lot been spotted recently on my river raft checks for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  It&#8217;s well outside the breeding season, and the bank vegetation has been cut back by the Environment Agency, so maybe not altogether surprising.</p>



<p>There was signs of an otter on one raft, so that is encouraging.  But earlier in the year I was seeing signs on all three rafts regularly.  Will be interesting to see if it picks up over winter.</p>



<p>The river level was very high today after the recent rains.  It&#8217;s over knee height in one place, so I may not be able to continue doing that safely over the next few weeks if the rain continues.</p>
