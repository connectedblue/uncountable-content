<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-x-large-font-size">&#8220;You cannot beat the market&#8221;</h2>



<p>You probably think you can.</p>



<p>You may even have a story where you made 100% on something over some time period.  But turning £10,000 into £20,000 does not mean you have beaten the market.  Nor is it particularly going to alter the course of your life.</p>



<p>Accepting <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guaranteed-market-return/" data-type="post" data-id="456">guaranteed market return</a> over many decades as an outcome greatly simplifies your investing journey. And will get you to <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-is-financial-independence/" data-type="post" data-id="529">the destination quicker</a>.</p>



<p>Market return is enough to bring you financial independence (when coupled with <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/most-important-factors-for-accumulating-wealth/" data-type="post" data-id="228">three other factors</a>).  You don&#8217;t really need to beat the market to build wealth.</p>



<p>Trying to beat market return will give you an 80% chance of under performing the market. The principle reason you can&#8217;t beat the market is you don&#8217;t possess more information than the market.</p>



<p>But that won&#8217;t stop you trying.  </p>



<p>The market is just a mechanism for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient. I&#8217;ll just patiently wait while you try.</p>
