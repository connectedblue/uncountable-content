<p>I need a second post on the blog so I can check that the layout and flow works.</p>



<p>So here it is.  </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s also a useful point to document the thinking behind the sites design.  This is a site where I want to write and organise the writing as easily as possible.  But I also want readers to have as a distraction free experience as as possible, but make it easy for them to explore the rest of the site if they wish.</p>



<p>So here is my initial thoughts on a site design:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No header, logo, menu or other distraction at the top.  Except for a discrete button to go from light to dark (and default to the user&#8217;s browser preference initially)</li>



<li>Every page starts with a title.  No author, date, read time, category, tag etc</li>



<li>Then the post content</li>



<li>No comments enabled.  But I will have a central guest book at some point.</li>



<li>At the bottom of the page, some menus and text to allow the reader to discover more content on the site.</li>



<li>The home page will contain the latest post, in the same layout as other pages in the site</li>
</ul>



<p>The colours and font will be neutral.  I&#8217;ll play around with some different options, but I don&#8217;t want either to draw attention to itself.</p>



<p>Posts will have multiple categories and tags, which wordpress will autogenerate archive pages for.  Most likely, I&#8217;ll in-line link to these from posts when necessary, rather than creating a laundry list of navigation links in a menu.</p>



<p>If I change my mind on the principles in the future, I&#8217;ll write another post to explain why.</p>
