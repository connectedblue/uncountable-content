<p>I&#8217;ve been creating a wildflower meadow in my tiny back garden for the last three years.  It&#8217;s chock full of different species ... knapweed, lesser trefoil, self heal, salad burnett, oxeye daisy and more.</p>



<p>But today I spotted yellow rattle.  For the first time.  Only about 5 or 6 young plants but enough to get going.  Once they set seed, there should be more next year.  This will hopefully thin the grass out and really let the wildflowers shine.</p>



<p>A long meeting with Richard today on the initial plan for the <a href="https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Walking Festival</a>.  It&#8217;s held in October but it&#8217;s good to have an early view of a strategy and approach.</p>
