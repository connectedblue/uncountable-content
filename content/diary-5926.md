<p>The pond planting continued at Fromebridge reserve, where we want to get as many saved plants as possible from the canal into the new pond.</p>



<p>We are on the last leg of the big pond, so on track to complete by the end of next week. When complete, we&#8217;ll go round again and infill any previously missed areas.</p>



<p>I spent most of the day in the pond, taking plants separated by the bank team.  The water levels are shallow at the moment, meaning we could go a reasonable distance to the pond centre.  </p>



<p>The water was not cold, so it was reasonably easy to just plant by hand after digging a V-shaped slit into the sandy shelf.</p>



<p>Meanwhile James and Barry completed a full planted circuit of one of the islands, giving that a great start.  There is a site camera installed which takes a picture every hour, so once we leave the area alone next week, we&#8217;ll be able to see progress of the growing vegetation.</p>
