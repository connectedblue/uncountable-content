<p>A long trip to the North Cotswolds this morning with <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a>, when the forecast was looking good until mid afternoon.  It was a huge field, very species rich, and we took two harvesters to get the best from the field.</p>



<p>But as soon as we pulled up in the field it started battering down.  There was also no sign of blue sky on the horizon.  Although we gave it half an hour, we knew we weren&#8217;t going to be able to do anything that day.  Once the plants are wet, the seed just sticks in the hopper and brushes and it doesn&#8217;t really work properly.</p>



<p>We took a walk around the fields to see what was in seed, and the quality of the different areas.  We would like to do this before the farmer does the hay cut, so we&#8217;re going to try again next Thursday.</p>
