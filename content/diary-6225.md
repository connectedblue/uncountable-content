<p>Not too much on the agenda today.  I had a call with Emma in the morning to discuss some of the next plans for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>, and what I&#8217;ll do over the summer and next term.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I headed over to Church Field to prepare the quadrats for the botanical survey tomorrow.  We have 29 quadrats which are re-surveyed every year, so we wanted to put flags at correct GPS locations.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a bit fiddly to get the Northing/Eastling coordinates correct, especially on a phone GPS.  Many times I located the right line, took a compass bearing and then strode confidently off in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>But we managed to get all out in about an hour or so, so well worth getting the ground ready before the surveyors arrive in the morning.</p>
