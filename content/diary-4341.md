<p>Beginning of the month, so a chance to meet up with Graham again for a spot of riverfly monitoring near the Ocean on the Frome.</p>



<p>I was expecting to perhaps see mayfly &#8211; they seem to be at their height in May (funnily enough), but maybe early March would be the first signs.  Anyway, the river levels were low, although the flow was strong, so there was a good chance of getting a good sample.</p>



<p>I did the kick sample for three minutes while Graham timed.  Almost straight away I spotted a <a href="https://www.riverflies.org/plecoptera">Stonefly</a>, which is the first time I&#8217;ve seen one at any of my sites in the past year or so.  We took some time to identify it (the first obvious one was to confirm it actually had two tails rather than three with one missing).  But we were both convinced in the end.</p>



<p>Sadly my photo of the stonefly looks like a small twig, so I don&#8217;t have a photographic record of the sighting.  But I&#8217;m hoping this is the start of many more we&#8217;ll see over the summer.</p>
