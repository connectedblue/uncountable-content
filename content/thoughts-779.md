<p>Spending falls into the two camps: <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/discretionary-vs-non-discretionary-spend/" data-type="post" data-id="512">discretionary and non-discretionary</a>. Of these, non-discretionary spend is the one to have a handle on for managing both day to day finances and <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/forecasting-investment-return/" data-type="post" data-id="289">long term projections</a>.</p>



<p>The best way to calculate the figure is to have an annual view.  This is because some non-discretionary expenses are annual (e.g. insurance), monthly (e.g. subscriptions) or weekly (e.g. food).  </p>



<p>Every three months, I download the last 12 months spend transactions from my current account.  I delete items that are just transfers between accounts and then scrutinise the rest for one-off, non-repeating spend.</p>



<p>For example, I bought a car, which is not something I&#8217;ll do every year. I also deleted a new wall that was built in the garden. However, I don&#8217;t delete the plumbing repairs, day trips or other one-offs because I&#8217;ll be incurring similar things in future. It&#8217;s the value of non-discretionary spend as it relates to your lifestyle that you are looking to estimate.</p>



<p>Another way to do this is to sort by value and just look at items over say Â£500.</p>



<p>Once you have that number, you can use it in your forecast models, to size your emergency fund and just for general budget purposes.  </p>



<p>If you repeat this every quarter, you will build up a view of how stable this number is, and also you&#8217;ll be keeping it up to date with inflation.  Hopefully you&#8217;ll find that it doesn&#8217;t vary much in structure, and it will help inform what you do with disposable income above this amount (shared between discretionary spend, <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/saving-versus-investing/" data-type="post" data-id="335">saving and investing</a>).</p>
