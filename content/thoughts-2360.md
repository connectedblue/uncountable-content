<p>I&#8217;m thrilled to be hosting the May 2025 <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb Blog Carnival</a> on a topic really close to my heart:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Small Web Communities</strong></p>



<p>Everyone is welcome to participate.  To enter, write a post on your blog and email me the link to <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a>.  Write in any language you choose.</p>



<p>Submissions are now in, which you can read in the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-roundup/" data-type="post" data-id="2533">round up post</a>.  If you have a piece to include, it&#8217;s not too late!  Just email me and I&#8217;ll add it in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a small web community?</h3>



<p>A community is a group of people who share a common interest or characteristic, and interact with each other in specific places, either geographical and/or online.  They have cultural, social and other bonds which bind them together, resulting in participation that allows the community to thrive.</p>



<p>A web community is a one where some, or all, the of the interaction between members takes place online.  There are many tools used to build web communities: forum software, WhatsApp groups, Discord, Zoom, blog networks and many, many more.</p>



<p>I believe strongly that small web communities are where the most engaging and fulfilling of all online interactions happen.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your experiences of them, why and how you participate and what you think are the key ingredients for a successful small web community.</p>



<p>My <a href="/small-web-communities/">own submission</a> for this month&#8217;s carnival explores the different small communities I participate in, and how they enhance my life.</p>



<p>I really can&#8217;t wait to read your submissions.  I&#8217;ll update the list below as they come in, so keep checking back during the month!</p>
