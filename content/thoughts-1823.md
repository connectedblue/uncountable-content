<p>Over my short life, there are a few milestones I view as step changes in capability &#8211; not just &#8220;a bit better&#8221; than the previous thing, but orders of magnitude better:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1981 &#8211; computer available in the home for £99.  A 1Kb RAM zx81 that plugged into your telly.  You had to type programs in before it could do anything (or load in from cassette tape).  Even in 1981, there wasn&#8217;t a lot could be done in 1Kb.  For comparison purposes, the little favicon that you see in the browser bar usually weighs in around 4Kb.</li>



<li>1996 &#8211; home internet access for £10 a month plus per minute phone line charges.  A 14.4Kb modem pulled websites and email into your house.  </li>



<li>2001 &#8211; 1Mb broadband line removing hefty charges for accessing content.</li>



<li>2007 &#8211; iPhone rollout.  By this point I had spent 11 years in the mobile communications industry.  What on earth were we all doing?</li>



<li>2016 &#8211; Alexa.  Voice control of information inside your home.  A single speaker replaces a stack of audio equipment in the living room.</li>



<li>2021 &#8211; Electric car.  Fill up at home.  Transport for 3p a mile.</li>



<li>2022 &#8211; ChatGPT.  A step change in the ability of robots to interact with humans</li>
</ul>



<p>In a little over 40 years, technology has increased in capability exponentially.  Every new introduction is accompanied by howls of anguish, with people declaring they have no need, or interest in such a thing.</p>



<p>But despite this, it just gets embedded into life.  There are very few people without an internet connection at home or on their phone (I do happen to know one such person though).  </p>



<p>Who&#8217;s still thumbing ancient copies of a road atlas to get around, in preference to plugging in google maps?</p>



<p>In twenty years time, you&#8217;ll be talking to your AI avatar buddy like they&#8217;re your best friend in the world.  You&#8217;ll be utterly unable to navigate the world without them.</p>



<p>And this is only the beginning.</p>
