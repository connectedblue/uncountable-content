<p>Met up with Graham for our regular monthly riverfly site check.  We weren&#8217;t expecting many deviations &#8211; it&#8217;s normally a species rich site, but you never know until you start sampling what you might find.</p>



<p>This month Graham did the kick sampling, while I timed for three minutes.  We could tell straight away looking at the bucket that there was a lot of life there.  We recorded a score of 9, which I think is the highest we have seen at that site.</p>



<p>We were also lucky enough to see a fly ready to pupate.  It was still on the water surface but had grown wings and looked as if it was ready to start learning how to take off.  That&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen that in a sample.</p>
