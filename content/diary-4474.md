<p>Down the lane at the side of my house where the garage is, is a small plot used as a vegetable garden and fruit trees. I planted a box hedge around 20 years ago (when I didn&#8217;t really know anything about hedges), and it recently fell victim to the box tree moth and had to be removed.</p>



<p>This was a good opportunity to replant a native hedge along the boundary with the public footpath.  I gave a donation to <a href="https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/">Stroud Valleys Project</a> and Stuart gave me 50 trees of hawthorn, blackthorn, spindle and holly.  This is enough for about 10 metres.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s getting towards the end of the tree planting season now, so I got them in this afternoon, hoping for rain a bit later on.  There have been rabbits in this area in the past, so I put the spiral guards on which I&#8217;ll remove in a couple of years.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal in around 8 years will be to lay the hedge which should make a nice thick, dog proof boundary that is also a haven for wildlife in the base.</p>
