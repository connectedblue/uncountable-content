<p>I met with Graham at the Ocean for our regular Riverfly check of the River Frome.  We had delayed it from Sunday due to the awful weather, and it was indeed much more pleasant this morning.</p>



<p>The spot is about a 15 minute walk away, and we ambled over in waders, carrying the gear.  After a quick check, we collected the kick and hand samples in the usual way.</p>



<p>I was a bit worried the counts might be low after <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/07/double-river-duty/" data-type="post" data-id="3401">my experience last week further upstream</a> with Tony.  However, we could see straight away that there was going to be a big haul.  </p>



<p>We recorded lots of different species, including the first mayfly and caseless caddisfly at this site.  And so many Olives and blue winged olives.  Overall the score was 10, much higher than previous months counts.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I headed over to the library for the last python <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> of this summer term.  The usual crew came along and we wrapped up what has been a pretty good year for all of them on their coding journey.</p>
