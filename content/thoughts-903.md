<p>A few days before the 2024 UK general election, I wrote <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/election-predictions/" data-type="post" data-id="871">a prediction post</a> for some fun, so this post reviews how I got on.</p>



<p>They were organised into ten areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Labour majority will be between 110 and 150.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It ended up at 172.  At the upper end of predictions, and less than Tony Blair in 1997.  Clearly a landslide, but 600,000 less people voted Labour than in 2019, and over 1m less than 2017.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Conservatives will get less than 100 seats.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They got 121.  Lowest ever I think. </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Lib Dems will get 60-80 seats.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>72.  Bang in the middle of the range.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Greens will win 3.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Yay!  They got 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>SNP will get 20 to 30 seats.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Collapsed to 9.  This was the big shock of the night and contributed to a Labour win in Scotland.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Nigel Farage will win Clacton.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Yes.  He did.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Turnout will be 67-69%.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was 60%.  Surprisingly low given the opportunity for change.  I don&#8217;t know who stayed away.  Tories probably. </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Rishi Sunak will resign on Friday, having lost his seat.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He did resign sort of.  He will stay on for a bit.  He didn&#8217;t lose his sit but he probably wishes he had so he could just go.  Bonus prediction:  He&#8217;ll resign his seat before the end of 2024.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Biggest post election talking point will be the imbalance of FPTP, with the focus being liberals on a lower vote share than Reform but with 10x the seats.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I think I&#8217;ll take this as a win.  The focus has been on Labour landslide with only 1% increase of vote share.  But lib dems did get lower vote share than reform with 15x the seats.  We won&#8217;t get PR before the next election, but I think we&#8217;re on a path that ends there.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Keir Starmer will create two new departments, one for Energy and Environment and the other for Business Growth.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He didn&#8217;t create any new departments, but did do two surprise appointments of Ministers in Patrick Vallence and James Timson</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>So four in ten of the predictions came in.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be the next John Curtice, but I&#8217;m very happy with the result as a whole.</p>
