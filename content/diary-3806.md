<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Got up early today to head for the thermal park at Wai &#8211; O &#8211; Tapu.  We wanted to get there for 10.15am to see the daily eruption of the Lady Knox geyser.  We got there in good time but were a little surpised to find that the geyser doesn&#8217;t start automatically but had to be coaxed into action by the guide putting a bar of soap down the blow hole.  We were assured though that it was a proper geyser, and would erupt of its own accord every 24-72 hours if it didn&#8217;t have the soap treatment.  Anyway, it was pretty impressive when it did erupt.</p>
<p>Walked around the rest of the thermal park afterwards.  Smelt very strongly of sulphur and there were loads of coloured pools and boiling mud pots.  Particularly impressive were the champagne lake and the white terraces.  Bought some children&#8217;s presents in the gift shop which had some really nice stuff.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we headed over to the Moari village of Whakerwakane south of Rotorua.  It&#8217;s still inhabited by 25 families and they use the thermal pools for cooking and bathing.  Saw a cultural display of Moari dancing and had a guided tour through the village.  The cooking pools were very good &#8211; bright blue and very hot bubbling water &#8211; the locals lower in vegetables in muslin bags and they get cooked after 10 minutes.  They also have wooden ovens which sit on top of steam vents which cook meat in 40 minutes.</div>
