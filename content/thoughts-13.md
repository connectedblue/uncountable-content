<p>Today I finally bit the bullet and finally created another blog to house all my non diary thoughts.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">an online diary</a> for about a year to record the things I do day to day.  I&#8217;ve been very happy with that, and it&#8217;s a nice way to share with the various groups I&#8217;m involved with.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s purpose is very clearly a diary.  If I started putting random thoughts or musings on investing, it would quickly become un-navigable and unreadable.</p>



<p>So this blog is for all that.  I probably won&#8217;t put images here and keep the styling as simple as possible.  New articles will get added when I feel like writing. But I want to get started on a few things burning through my mind:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lifestyle investing and financial independence</li>



<li>Transitioning to retirement</li>



<li>Indieweb</li>



<li>Tech side projects</li>
</ul>



<p>I&#8217;ll create some categories to organise the posts to help readers find only the topics that interest them.</p>
