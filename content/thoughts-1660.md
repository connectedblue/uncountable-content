<p>I own the house which I live in.  But I don&#8217;t include it&#8217;s value in my net worth.  In fact, it&#8217;s not even an investment, because it does not produce <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/saving-versus-investing/" data-type="post" data-id="335">future cash flows</a> to fund my lifestyle.</p>



<p>It would be an option for me to own other property though, and that would be an investment.  There are a number of reasons why I haven&#8217;t chosen this path at all over the last 26 years:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Indivisibility of the asset.  If you need some money, you can&#8217;t sell a bathroom.  </li>



<li>No tax shelter.  There is no easy way to place rental income and capital gains inside a tax free wrapper in the UK.</li>



<li>Unknown cost of future regulation.  Regulations on landlords and protections for tenants make future return difficult to predict.</li>



<li>Management overhead.  The fees associated with letting, maintenance, upgrades, legal, selling and stamp duty eat into overall returns.</li>



<li>Voids.  No rental income is earned in between tenancies.</li>



<li>Non-existent capital appreciation. The value of my own home plus improvements has not kept place with inflation since 2005. Even stripping out the improvements, it would struggle to break even in real terms (especially if it were in the state it was in 2005).</li>



<li>Lack of diversification.  Owning a house is linked to the fortunes of one location.  There are very different dynamics in different regions.  Even if I had a portfolio of ten properties, that is hardly representative of the entire UK market.   </li>



<li>Capital Gains Tax.  Indexation isn&#8217;t allowed any more, so your gain is calculated on nominal return &#8211; essentially the price difference between selling and buying.  This tax eats into your already non-existent real returns further.  At the moment, CGT rates are considerably higher for property than other assets.  And lastly, because you can&#8217;t sell anything less than a whole house, you have to take the entire hit in a single tax year.  CGT is the final cut to your shredded dreams.</li>
</ul>



<p>There is a general belief across the population that owning a rental property is the safest and surest way to build wealth (although oddly, mostly among people who do not invest in property).  Unless you happened to purchase your property portfolio before 2000, landlords will have had an extremely difficult job to make money.</p>



<p>In the end, investing in low cost, passive stock market index funds produced way better real total returns over the last quarter of a century than owning rental property.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve not seen any evidence that shows me that&#8217;s about to change over the next 25 years.</p>
