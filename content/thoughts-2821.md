<p>I got home from a morning of <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/12/new-trees-for-the-playing-field/">grassland restoration</a> and found an email from <a href="https://peterspath.net/">Peter</a> in my inbox:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--1">
<p>I have discovered a lot of new blogs and people through those [slash] pages and directories.</p>



<p>So I thought it was time to contribute with a directory and a slash page movement of my own.</p>



<p>A /top4 page is a personal webpage where you can share your definitive ranked list of your top 3 favorites and an honorable mention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a great idea.  Not just to have a <code>/top4</code> page but also to put together a directory of such pages.  </p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve put together my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/top4/" data-type="post" data-id="2816">own top4 page</a> covering three areas I am most passionate about.  I still have to think how and where to add this into the navigation of my site, but I like it as a &#8220;quick fire round&#8221; of who I am.  This has also been added to the <a href="https://topfour.net/">top4.net directory</a>.</p>



<p>Directories are also a very important piece of infrastructure for the independent web.  These little, curated hubs are how we discover each other (I deliberately <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/not-on-google/" data-type="post" data-id="515">disable search indexing</a> on my domain).  </p>



<p>If you have a website, I encourage you to make a <code>/top4</code> page and submit it into the directory.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A digression about directory ordering</h3>



<p>This, and other directories are typically ordered alphabetically.  This might seem fair enough on the surface &#8211; after all, that&#8217;s how telephone directories conditioned us to think about the genre.</p>



<p>However, that&#8217;s not how the reader would navigate a 50+ directory of top 4 links. They would just look at the first few and click on a couple. So the writer of &#8220;AAACME Blog&#8221; gets a distinct advantage of premium placement over mine (uncountable thoughts), for example.</p>



<p>My way of solving this problem is to take an MD5 hash of today&#8217;s date and the web address and sort by that instead. This gives a new daily random ordering, with every website having an equal chance of being at the top.</p>



<p>You can see this in action in a website I built for my local town where the <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/info/shops/">high street traders are listed</a>.  Again, no-one is going to this page to &#8220;look up&#8221; a particular trader.  They just want to see what shops we have.  So the ordering means we don&#8217;t favour one shop above another (especially important on mobile).</p>



<p>I also do similar on The Artocalypse where the order of artists in one of <a href="https://the.artocalypse.org/expo/2025-end-of-year-artist-feature/">our online expos</a> is different every day.  People may not scroll through the whole thing so every artist gets an equal chance to be first in the list.</p>
