<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>In the morning went into Hastings to have a look around and get some money out after the problems of yesterday in Napier.</p>
<p>At 1.30pm, our wine tour picked us up outside the cottage. We went to three wineries:  Salvare, Unison and Selini.  The Unison winery is run by a couple of ex-pat brits who took over the vineyard about three years ago and have produced a lot of award winning wine.  He also gave us a tour of the vines and explained the differences between the various grapes.  </p>
<p>The salvare winery also had great white wines (about 80% of Hawkes Bay is red).  They also had some good food items &#8211; we bought some dukka which is a blend of spices and nuts which you dunk with bread and olive oil &#8211; very tasty.  They also had some good vinegar for salads.</p>
<p>The tastings of wine were good &#8211; each place gave  tasters for 6 wines (small amounts in each glass) but enough to get an idea of the different flavours.</div>
