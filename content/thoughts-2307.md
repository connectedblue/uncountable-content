<p>Video calls happen on the following link, which is best accessed from a PC rather than phone:</p>



<p><a href="https://meet.jit.si/DamagingJudgementsMarketPolitely">Jitsi Video Bridge</a></p>



<p>No login is required to join the call, except if you are the organiser (see below).</p>



<p>There is also an option to dial in on the following:</p>



<p>Phone:  0203 885 2179<br>PIN:   3066 2380 95#</p>



<p>See below if you have technical issues joining the call.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technical issues joining</h3>



<p>The Jitsi platform is free, performant, functional, anonymous and no login is required. </p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s not without issues sometimes and people have struggled to get their sound and microphones working on their devices. The following tips may help:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The most reliable way is to join from a laptop.  If the mic and sound doesn&#8217;t work, you can fix on chrome as follows:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Goto the permissions menu next to the padlock in the browser bar</li>



<li>if camera and/or mic are shown as allowed, click the cross to clear them.</li>



<li>reload the page and after a few seconds, it should re-ask for permissions for both.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Sound doesn&#8217;t seem to work for Macs on either Chrome or Safari out of the box, unless you know how to fiddle with settings.</li>



<li>Joining from a phone by clicking the &#8220;join in browser&#8221; link, however note:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Android with Chrome should work fine </li>



<li>iPhones don&#8217;t work at all when joining from the browser. But you can download the app from the prompt on the screen after clicking the link. Permission settings are also required when installing the app.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In the app, you can manually type in the room name DamagingJudgementsMarketPolitely (it won&#8217;t let you copy and paste) and then permissions are asked for manually.  You can save this conversation so hopefully you won&#8217;t have to enter every time.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The iPad app works with no problems</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>There is a text chat feature in the app, so if you are in the room and think there&#8217;s a problem, drop a message in that.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organising a call</h3>



<p>Call organisers will need to join first with a login to allow other participants to get in. The easiest way to do this is with a google account, but other options are available too.</p>



<p>Once logged in, people can just join the call.  You will have some moderation options such as muting all.</p>
