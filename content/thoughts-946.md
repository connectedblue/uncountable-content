<p>I&#8217;m really curious . . .</p>



<p>Do people without a blog use RSS readers on a regular basis?  I mean, of course, anyone can use RSS.  But do they?  Or is it just bloggers who are the avid users?</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re reading this on RSS, and you don&#8217;t have a blog, would you <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/contact-me/" data-type="post" data-id="218">contact me</a> and let me know?</p>
