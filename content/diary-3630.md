<p>It was a blazing hot day, as it had been the last few weeks, and I left Pure Planet for the last time around 5pm.  I walked up the hill through Bath to the top where I parked my car, and experienced a feeling that my life was about to fundamentally change, although I did not know quite how.</p>



<p>There was no send off of any sort.  Everyone was expecting me to return in 7 months after a period of sabbatical.  My main feeling was one of relief.  I had finished a major project on direct debit reviews and just wanted to forget about work for a while.</p>



<p>By this point, the only reason to carry on working was to get money.  And I didn&#8217;t need more money.  I was burning out.  I didn&#8217;t know if I wanted to have two months or two years away from work (the sabbatical turned out to be a compromise with my employer who didn&#8217;t want me to resign fully as I had back in May).</p>



<p>I would shortly be 51, and had a deep feeling that I wanted to traverse my fifties on my own terms, whatever that may mean. I had completed exactly 29 years of career <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/1990/09/first-day-of-work/" data-type="post" data-id="3632">since my first day of work</a>. I found it long, varied and fulfilling but didn&#8217;t really feel like putting in another 11 just to make a nice round number.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t even have a photograph from this day.  It was as unremarkable as most of the previous 29 years working days.</p>
