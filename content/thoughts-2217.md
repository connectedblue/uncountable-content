<p>At the time of writing in 2025, there are two principal ways to withdraw from a SIPP:  Tax free cash and taxable income.  You can choose the amount and regularity in the best way to suit circumstances, subject to two major constraints:  </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>To access tax free cash, you must move funds from the uncrystallised portion of the SIPP.  Up to 25% of that is paid immediately tax free.  The remainder then becomes taxable as income (which you can choose to withdraw or leave invested).  The amount of tax free cash is subject to an overall lifetime limit of around £268K.</li>



<li>The tax on income is calculated in accordance with the rates and allowances applicable to the tax year of withdrawal.  Unused allowances do not roll over.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are below State Pension Age, and have no other taxable income, then the first £12K of SIPP withdrawal will also be tax free.  But beyond this, it&#8217;s clear that you will be obliged to pay at least 20% tax on at least 75% of the current value of your SIPP (assuming current tax policy remains in place).</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t need cash to fund your immediate lifestyle, you might be tempted to leave it to accumulate tax free and pay the 20% later.  But this just compounds the taxable constraints later &#8211; making it more likely to be paying 40% to withdraw larger amounts in a single tax year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recycling into ISA</h3>



<p>There is another allowance that expires each year, the limit of £20K that can be invested into an ISA.  The big benefit of ISA is that the growth and subsequent withdrawal is tax free, regardless of size.  Furthermore, if you are married or in a civil partnership, the whole amount can be transferred tax free to the surviving spouse after death.</p>



<p>Mathematically speaking, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you pay 20% tax now or 20% in the future inside a SIPP &#8211; you end up with the same net amount.  </p>



<p>These leads to a nice washing machine effect you can spin each tax year from SIPP to ISA to maximise the utility from taxable allowances and ISA contribution limits.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Drain rate</h3>



<p>This depends very much on circumstances:  current SIPP value, lifestyle spend, single or couple to name a few.  But I&#8217;ll illustrate a maximal scenario below and the principles can be applied to more specific cases.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll assume a household of two, with a single SIPP over £1m and the SIPP holder under state pension age.  This has been chosen because there&#8217;s no more tax free cash available from investment growth, and also it will take at least 20 years to withdraw at basic rate so there are lots of allowances to be utilised.  </p>



<p>The first step is to crystallise £67K from the uncrystallised portion of the SIPP. This triggers immediate tax free cash of £17K. The remaining £50K is then withdrawn as income, triggering a 20% tax change of £7.5K on the excess over £12.5K.</p>



<p>(Aside:  if you withdraw the full £50K in one go, you will pay much more tax that this because the payroll system will treat you the same as if you earning a monthly salary of £50K.  However, the excess over £7.5K can be claimed back using a simple P55 online form and it&#8217;s repaid into your bank account 8 weeks later).</p>



<p>This leaves £59.5K in the bank account of our household couple.  They use £19.5K to fund their current lifestyle and then reinvest £40K back into two ISA accounts in exactly the same investments they just sold in the SIPP.</p>



<p>So leaving aside fees and market movements while this washing machine cycles, the couple are in a better position with the £40K because that still grows tax free and can be withdrawn with no further penalty at any future point.  Effectively, £67K has been freed from the SIPP at a tax cost of £7.5K (or 11%).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of a slow SIPP drain</h3>



<p>The big benefit comes after doing this for several years.  If you suddenly need to put your hands on say £200K, then after 5 years you can withdraw that from the ISA with no further tax to pay.  Contrast that with having to get £200K net from a SIPP in a single tax year &#8211; you&#8217;d have to withdraw way more than this which would trigger 40% and 45% tax charges.</p>



<p>The other benefit is that you have (hopefully) a large runway of years in front of you to do this, so large pots will get used up (as they are no longer useful to keep for inheritance purposes).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Downsides to a slow drain</h3>



<p>The big unknown is future tax policy, both for SIPPs and ISA.  It&#8217;s virtually impossible to predict the future (although for SIPPs, I think it will only stay the same, or get worse, for those in drawdown today).  </p>



<p>ISAs could get capped, scrapped or any multitude of things in between.</p>



<p>But, it is a slow drain, not a dam buster.  If the political environment changes, you&#8217;ll need to assess the impacts and change course if it makes sense to do so.</p>



<p>Not knowing the future isn&#8217;t a reason to not act today though.  We can all only work within the framework that exists, so maximising the benefits before they disappear is something you are unlikely to regret.</p>
