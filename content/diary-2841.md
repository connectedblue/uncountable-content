<p>Pure Planet went into live service at the end of March, just six months after I started.  The first part of the year was a hectic blur, dominated by work, broken only by the Crickhowell Walking festival in early March.</p>



<p>In April I decided to accept a full time role with the company as a Data Scientist.  I had not long completed the year long data science course online and this felt like a good opportunity to put it into practice.</p>



<p>This also meant that I didn&#8217;t really play an active role in the development of the service after it went live.  Instead I was free to determine how the data that started flowing could be used to address emerging business questions.</p>



<p>Outside of work, time was mostly spent walking, cooking and watching football.  Holidays in Scotland and the Canary Islands provided breaks from the daily routine.</p>



<p>These recollections are as I remember them in January 2024.</p>
