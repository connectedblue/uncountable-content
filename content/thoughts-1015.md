<p>Spent the last week or so trying to improve the experience for people who follow my blog via RSS, or visit it from the web.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m only going to publish a maximum of two main posts a day at set times.  This means I can set up quite a bit of content in advance, so I give the RSS subscribers a teaser of what&#8217;s coming soon in a small note at the bottom.</p>
