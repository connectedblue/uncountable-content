<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member BorisGoodEnough who talks about coming to study and work in the UK and his approach to ethical investing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>A European, came to study in the UK and never left… I worked with official statistics as a researcher and data manager for 25 years. Until then I had never earned more than the minimum wage. </p>



<p>Saving carefully has been my default setting, thanks to having frugal parents who knew hardship in WW2. Now retired. </p>



<p>Investing is all the more interesting when you try to know backgrounds to the global economy, shifts in dynamics, global developments, population ageing, the psychology of the markets, and to be able to separate reality from hype and hot air. </p>



<p>My focus is on green and social investing as future generations will have to live with the effects of our actions, wherever they may live.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the principal features of a company or fund that you look for to fit with this ethical style of investing?</h3>



<p>Individual companies are not really my aim, although I have some, like Sainsbury’s. Now that I see the cost-cutting happening at Sainsbury’s with a reduced level of service as a result, I have my doubts about it. This can drive customers away when better options are available nearby.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>In the 1990s we worked abroad and in our absence (no internet) some money was invested for us. In 1998 we found ourselves in the UK with the Y2K bubble blowing up. We sold nearly all of our investments in one single day, which gave us a more than decent deposit for our first house!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then I have been more careful. The ISA paradise in the UK is unique. The financial system and the tax system here have been invented by and for the wealthy section of the population. Shielding your money from the taxman in PEPs and ISAs (without using a tax adviser) is unique. I try to use my ISA allowance when I can. My wife does so independently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Did you intend to stay in the UK permanently when you first arrived?</h3>



<p>No, you have to test the water and see what is in it for you. As a voluntary migrant you always tend to live in two countries, well I do.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>No fixed goals, it is a game and not a gamble. I have slowly built up a portfolio of funds, ETFs and a few shares since 2005. Reading the Money Observer regularly gave me more background information. </p>



<p>I shy away from anti-social parts of our capitalist system: fossil fuels, mining, arms, chemicals, human exploitation. Honest and valuable production of daily needs by family run companies should be a separate sector in the economy !&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?</h3>



<p>Being retired without particular financial strains or debts I am relatively free to invest according to my own plan. I am happy with an overall return (over time) of 4-5% per annum.  My portfolio is well spread and more orientated towards ESG/SRI investments. </p>



<p>Over time I had to weed out baddies. Following the Brexit outcome I ditched nearly all of my UK investments, without any regret. Still, the UK market is not my main focus. </p>



<p>Income investing in UK funds mostly drives you towards those investments that I do not want to invest in, so that is a no. Technology can be more of a hype than a real addition to the economy. Time will tell. Most global funds are over-weighted towards the US. I expect some returns from India and Asia-Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parts of the UK economy need to be seriously regulated:&nbsp; Betting firms, Deliveroo, Amazon, AirBnB, etc. All those global companies that are earning without paying proper taxes and could be exploitative towards workers and customers. </p>



<p>Banks are a different chapter and history tells me that they have to be on a lead due to frequent money laundering. Yes, I am a sort of a Piketty when it comes to attitude towards the vast global wealth that knows no borders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us about your decision to retire &#8211; the factors you considered and what role did your portfolio play?</h3>



<p>I invested in my pension because I started in my 40s. That is pretty tax efficient here. The retirement date chosen was partly dependent on age, but also due to the mad Covid years where everything was more tense than ever before. </p>



<p>A rest was welcome.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>My lifestyle is frugal enough in order not to take anything out of the ISA sweetshop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your sources of income in retirement, if not your investment portfolio?</h3>



<p>Several pensions from two different countries and state pension, for which I bought added years long time ago.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>Not too adventurous, increasingly built on knowledge and principles, rather than gains. I am definitely a long-term investor and not into fashion, bitcoin, or trends that I do not fully understand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What advice do you have for incomers to the UK looking to start a working life here?</h3>



<p>When I came here to study in the 1990s there were ample opportunities in Britain. Well, I saw them, and found them easily. Now retired, the UK economy is shifting towards more service jobs, which have lower job certainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some sectors will always need specialised staff: where are the quantity surveyors, the vets, the medics, the qualified builders that are lacking in today’s job market?</p>



<p>The worrying thing is that a fair part of the people of working age are either sick and less healthy, or lower qualified, or even unqualified. The education system churns out young people without proper luggage for life as it is still a class system here. With wealth behind you, you will get more remuneration, with the wrong postcode you are left to your own devices. </p>



<p>Britain is much more unequal than countries like France and Germany where employers try to hold onto you as a worker and add further skills to what you have obtained already. In Britain workers are more of a commodity, which is bad news for many, and not good enterprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This inequality makes migrants ever so necessary, just like in the past, where the Irish labourers built the roads and houses and filled ranks in the army.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I read the financial pages in newspapers, the Interactive Investor website and I visit a few websites like Morningstar and Trustnet to scrape more information together. </p>



<p>I am not fond of league tables as they tend to compare apples with pears. I take time to make an informed decision. There are ample forums to consult.</p>



<p>I also try to be aware of the economic theories that are around. Globalisation has brought us good and bad and we need to understand where we are and what we are facing in the future. Crypto is there, AI will increasingly play a role in our lives. “Growth” is in fashion, but it also means that somewhere else in the world negative growth will occur. Focus on winners and losers in the global monopoly game.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear other people’s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>The Western economic system is a jungle and not very well developed and planned. It is a chance market of taking risks. What sections do we want to maintain and keep for the next 100 years ?&nbsp; Seriously, our actions of today may seriously affect those who live tomorrow and after tomorrow. I am a pacifist who would like to look after the globe with a view that is much wider than my own county, country and continent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have to share awareness of social media, influencers. AI and the risks attached to them. Remember, we can easily become a pawn in someone else’s game (Bob Dylan).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personally I would go green and socially responsible at all times. I avoid multinational firms that do not contribute (or only little) the the British economy. Where can you invest when the banks favour fossil fuels and are reluctant about renewals (which will need government support for a longer period than expected) ?&nbsp; If you want to invest for income then you will have to turn to non-green as they pay the largest dividends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you use your money responsibly? Crowd funding perhaps?</p>



<p>And then a hot potato: taxation. As a country we need to plan ahead and spending is a function of taxation. Politicians are too stubborn to adjust taxation when the needs are high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Income, wealth, buying luxury goods, unhealthy items, etc. are taxed. The current tax system over-taxes the lower incomes and leaves other areas untouched.&nbsp;</p>

<section class="p-and-m-summary"><article><h2>Ruslan Osipov</h2><p>My name is Ruslan. I&rsquo;m in my mid-thirties, I live in San Diego, California with my wife and daughter - and I currently work at Google as an engineering manager focused on improving company-wide engineering productivity.</p><p>I grew up outside of the United States - in a small rural town in Russia. I grew up with my mom - we weren&rsquo;t particularly well off nor did we want for anything - and my mom&rsquo;s approach to finance influenced my views. My mom was (she&rsquo;s well, but retired) an accountant who survived the USSR breakup, numerous currency changes, multiple recessions and currency inflation - the financial landscape was marred by instability. Probably because of that, my mom is very frugal and deliberate with money.</p>
