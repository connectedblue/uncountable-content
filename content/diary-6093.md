<p>Early start for the regular monthly riverfly check with Graham at the Ocean.  River levels were very low today, so a chance to go right across the whole width.</p>



<p>When I started the kick sample, I disturbed what looked like blue painted stones on the river bed.  Definitely an odd, inexplicable find, so we took photos to report back to the landowner for further investigation.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to dampen down the samples though.  A huge number of fish and water beetle swimming about among the larvae.  We got a pretty solid score of 8, which is consistent with what we&#8217;ve been seeing recently.</p>



<p>On the way back home, I stopped by Uley Common to see how that was doing in the growing season.  It was looking pretty nice &#8211; the grassland was spreading nicely, although there are patches of bramble and hemp agrimony encroaching from the sides.</p>



<p>But also there were nice woodland edge plants such as dog&#8217;s mercury and hedge woundwort.  I took the opportunity to restack some of the dead hedge which frees up a bit more ground for the grassland to spread,</p>
