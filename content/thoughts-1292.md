<p>Sam is thinking about <a href="https://samjc.me/2024/08/06/lets-just-have.html">if we demand less AI</a> that will lead to a reduction in the environmental impact of the technology:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--5">
<p>AI is not currently providing many benefits for many people — sure it’s helping some people write email more efficiently, and it is assisting some programmers. But most people don’t use AI, and don’t have a use for AI. All AI is doing for them is putting more spam and fake news into their feeds, and making search results worse.</p>



<p>So the obvious way to bring down the emissions from AI is&nbsp;<em>less AI</em>. We don’t need it. Many (most?) of us don’t want it. And if the market doesn’t bring about this change, then we can use policy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I remember similar discussions about google a couple of decades ago &#8211; things like every search query is equivalent to boiling a kettle.  I&#8217;m trying to assess whether I use more or less search than I did say five years ago.  I don&#8217;t really know &#8211; I suspect I&#8217;m just using more of everything with each passing year.</p>



<p>The difference with AI is that the energy usage pretty much all occurs before users get to use it.  Once a model is trained, the energy needed to convert a single input into an output is negligible.  In that sense, reducing demand doesn&#8217;t really move the needle in environmental terms.</p>



<p>We are already seeing a check on training new models in the financial markets.  Most spend (and hence environmental impact) is concentrated in Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon and Tesla &#8211; with Microsoft and Meta standing head and shoulders above the others.  </p>



<p>They have cornered the market in the resources needed for AI, just as Google cornered the market in compute during the 2000s.  Their shareholders will be scrutinising the returns on those very significant up front outlays.  If the returns don&#8217;t materialise, then new models won&#8217;t be trained.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure we are standing on the same precipice as just before the dot com crash of the early 2000s, but there are parallels.  Back then, there was a gold rush to invest before the actual uses of the technology were understood.    AI investment is facing the same question today.</p>



<p>My view is that although we don&#8217;t yet know what AI will be used for, in 20 years time we will look back and say it was obvious we had to develop it.  Just like we look back on early 2000s now and say it was obvious that the internet was important to build.</p>
