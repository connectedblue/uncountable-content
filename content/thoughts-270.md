<p>Something is Good Enough if it can be used without any more effort put in to it&#8217;s creation.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s not good enough, then you have no choice but to abandon it, or continue working until it is.  But after that, you can stop.  Because it&#8217;s Good Enough.  </p>



<p>This post is Good Enough if you, my reader, are left with a broad idea of the points I&#8217;m making.  For sure, someone else might make the same points with fewer words, more inspiring, funnier or any other axis along which better can be measured.</p>



<p>But Good Enough is not an unchanging, universal state across all future points in time.  Everything needs to be maintained, to keep it Good Enough.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographers%27_A%E2%80%93Z_Street_Atlas">A-Z</a> was Good Enough to get around London in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s (and before).  But it needed to be updated and reprinted to do so.  The broad road map doesn&#8217;t change over decades, but there are plenty of minor updates which would render your old copy &#8220;not good enough&#8221; if you happened to want to get to a place that had changed.</p>



<p>While maintenance keeps things good enough, it does not make them immune to innovation and replacement. Suddenly something that maybe is Good Enough doesn&#8217;t get used any more because something better exists.</p>



<p>Today Google Maps is a better solution for getting around London.  I used it yesterday and also found it Good Enough.  I suppose A-Z is still on sale, but I suspect the revenue is falling and there&#8217;ll no longer be incentive to maintain Good Enough print copies and it will slowly fade into obscurity.</p>



<p>The interesting distinction between maintenance and innovation is the unforeseen disruption to the way something is created.  No amount of maintenance to the A-Z would have produced Google Maps.</p>



<p>So stop looking for perfection.  When something is Good Enough, then use it.  Keep it maintained so it remains useful.  And be prepared to embrace something else when that surely arrives.</p>
