<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Got up early and headed down to Puamaemu Beach to get the 9am ferry across to Kapiti Island.  This is a nature reserve over 100 years old which was finally cleared of pests and predators in 1996.  It&#8217;s now home to lots of different bird species and fauna.</p>
<p>Access to the island is strictly controlled &#8211; only 50 visitors  per day which is why we needed to get a permit.  After landing we got a talk about the island from the guide who told us about the different species on the island and the rules.</p>
<p>We set off to the summit along the Trig path which is the steeper one.  The highest point is only 537m, but it took a good two hours to walk up because we stopped all along the way to listen out for birds.  After lunch at the top we took the Wilkinson track down which was a bit less steep than the path up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a restored historic house called a Whare which is where the original conservationist stayed when they made it a nature reserve in 1897.  Before that it was intensely farmed and 75% of the island was cleared for grazing.  There used to be 3000 inhabitants and it was a pretty lawless place.</p>
<p>The ferry came back at 3pm and took us back.  Spent some time on Paunauru beach before heading back.</div>
