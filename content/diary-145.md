<p>In a couple of weeks I&#8217;m giving a talk at the AGM of the <a href="https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stroudwildlifesurvey.org.uk">Stroud Wildlife Survey Group</a> about the work the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust are doing along the Stroudwater Canal.</p>



<p>To prepare for it, I met with Pete who is the Project Officer for the wildlife trust on the environmental aspects of the project.  I do a lot of work with him, so I&#8217;m very familiar with the project, but it was good to take the time to run through everything from scratch.  Always new details to pick up on that I hadn&#8217;t heard before.</p>



<p>We came up with a good narrative, and he gave me some supporting materials and resources for the talk.  Look forward to putting the presentation together over the next few days.</p>
