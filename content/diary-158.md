<p>Change of plan today.  I had a calendar entry to join <a href="https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.stroudvalleysproject.org/">Stroud Valleys Projects</a> on a task by the canal.  But my arm is still playing up, having injured it some weeks ago.  So I decided not to aggravate it any further and sadly told Ruth I wouldn&#8217;t be attending.</p>



<p>Instead I took a trip to Stroud.  Despite this being close, it&#8217;s not a place I visit often.  I&#8217;m usually just passing through on the way to the Slad Valley or the North Cotswolds.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a magnificent public space called <a href="https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/parks-and-green-spaces/stratford-park" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/parks-and-green-spaces/stratford-park">Stratford Park</a>.   Its 56 acre grounds are packed with amenities like a musuem, sports area, wildflower meadow and and arboretum.  Huge Turkey oaks, Cedars and Sequoias are some of the highlights.</p>
