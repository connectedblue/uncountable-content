<p>We use all sorts of spreadsheets and other planning tools to forecast whether our portfolios will meet our future lifestyles.  Underpinning all these models are a set of assumptions we have to make about what the future will look like.</p>



<p>This is an exercise to collate a standard a view as possible about the actual values we use for these various assumptions.  If you would like to take part, read on &#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Access the survey</h3>



<p>The spreadsheet is best viewed on a PC and can be found on the following link:</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to sign in or request access.  You can add your ii member name to the bottom and fill in the relevant boxes for you.  You can&#8217;t add extra columns, but if you have an assumption you use that&#8217;s not there, make a note of the assumption and value in a note on the last column and I&#8217;ll create a new column for it.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t use, or don&#8217;t want to reveal a particular assumption, just leave it blank.  Note that &#8220;Year Actual/Planned Drawdown Start&#8221; does not reveal your age!  But it will be interesting to group assumptions by different stages in the journey.</p>



<p>When putting in % for long term investment returns, it&#8217;s helpful to express that relative to inflation rather than absolute values.  So if you use an average of 3% for inflation and 8% for SIPP returns, then you would enter 5% in that column.  Similarly, if you assume 2% for absolute return on cash, you&#8217;d enter -1%.</p>



<p>Please be careful to only update your own line and not accidentally overwrite other entries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Analysing the aggregates</h3>



<p>When quite a few entries have been added, I&#8217;ll start to add some basic averages and summaries of the data.  This will be useful for you to check how your own view of the future compares to others.</p>



<p>We will have a discussion of this topic at a future meeting of the @Retirement Zoom Group, so if you haven&#8217;t joined that already, search for it on the app and join for further details. </p>
