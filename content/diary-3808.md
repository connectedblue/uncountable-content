<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Went to Tauranga town in the morning to get our bearings.  Not much to see in the town, although we found a great fruit and veg market to top up supplies. </p>
<p>In the afternoon, we drove down to Rotorua &#8211; the magnet for hotpools and steam pools.  Very very hot today so just walking around was quite tiring.  Went into the museum which was a old bath house in the Governement gardens.  Really interesting museum talking about the history of the area and the moaris.</div>
