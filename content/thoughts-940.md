<p>I have over 600 feeds in my RSS reader, around 75% are blogs of some sort and the remainder news sites and youtube subscriptions.  I use it several times a day as a way of <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/own-your-scroll/" data-type="post" data-id="690">owning my own scroll</a>.</p>



<p>My platform is a self hosted version of <a href="https://freshrss.org/index.html">FreshRSS</a> which gives ample flexibility.  It has a great feature where you can just review all the feeds with errors.</p>



<p>Just spent half an hour cleaning up about 15 feeds that had problems, ranging from websites disappearing completely to changes in the RSS url.  I even dropped a note to one author who appeared to have a certificate expiry.</p>



<p>Well worth doing.  The server is set to query every six hours &#8211; partly because I want to be a good RSS citizen and query as little as possible.  But also to prevent me chasing my own scroll.</p>



<p>So a little bit of housekeeping keeps things shipshape and functional.  I add new feeds liberally (usually from links in existing posts) but prune back only rarely.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a feed I feel in control of.</p>
