<p>Met with Tony for the regular monthly riverfly check at Ebley.  We&#8217;ve been advised to monitor a new location about 100m up from the site we&#8217;ve been doing a few years where we might get better results.</p>



<p>We will try and keep doing both locations for a while to compare but today were short of time so we just did the new site.</p>



<p>It was immediately obvious from the number of gammarus there would be a healthy score.  A number of other species too, including a mayfly, but only one or two examples, so not perhaps the full recovery just yet from the long drought and low flow levels for most of this year.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no trigger set yet for the site, but the score of 7 would probably comfortably exceed the assigned one.</p>



<p>I stayed in the rest of the day, waiting for a new PC to be delivered which didn&#8217;t arrive until the evening.  Many fun hours lie ahead getting it set up the way I wanted.</p>
