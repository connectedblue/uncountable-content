<p>A leisurely day today, with only the regular <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> raft check to do.  The route to one of the rafts was inaccessible due to road closure, so I concentrated on the other two.</p>



<p>There was nothing remarkable to report on either raft &#8211; some otter speint on one and that was about it.   However, one of the tributaries was immediately noticeable because it was covered completely in green duck weed &#8211; something I hadn&#8217;t seen before.</p>



<p>I thought it was algae at first which would be a genuine concern and a possible sign of upstream pollution.  However, it turned out to be duckweed, which is reasonably common, but definitely an infestation on this site.</p>



<p>It can cause oxygenation issues in the water over time, but there is very little to do about it at this time.  I pass by this stretch every two weeks, so I&#8217;ll keep a check.</p>
