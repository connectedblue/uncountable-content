<p>Elisabeth is reminiscing about when <a href="https://optimisticmusings.com/phone-numbers/">we all used to remember phone numbers</a> in the days before mobiles and everything else:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--1">
<p>At the time, I knew a lot of phone numbers: all my friends’, and of course our home phone landline.</p>



<p>But now it’s a little horrifying how few I remember.</p>



<p>I know my own (though I have to stop and think about it).<br>I know John’s.<br>I know my parents’ home phone.<br>I know 911. Does that count?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I know mine.  And I know my mum&#8217;s landline from ten years ago (but not her current one).  But that&#8217;s it really.  </p>



<p>On the very rare occasions I dial a number at all, it&#8217;s invariably wrong.  Numbers copied from something awkward like a sign or piece of paper usually results in some digits being flipped in the process.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s also true that I could remember a lot of numbers in the 80s and 90s through frequent punching out.  All that stopped in 1996 when I had my first mobile phone (co-incidentally through my employer Orange, a mobile service provider).</p>



<p>But as with all things connected with time, it&#8217;s important to distinguish behaviour as a result of being a child from behaviour by adults back then.  If you ever catch yourself saying something like &#8220;people were so much nicer to each other in the 70s&#8221;, remember that they were nice to you because you were a child.  Adults were no more (or no less) nicer to each other then as today.  </p>



<p>So maybe the reason I could remember a lot of numbers in the 80s is because my social circle was small.  My parents certainly didn&#8217;t remember every number they dialled.  There was a little book by the telephone, indexed by letter, with all the numbers  that were needed.</p>



<p>I used to like looking through that book, and asking who all the names were.  I was staggered by the sheer number of them.  I couldn&#8217;t possibly conceive how on earth you could know so many people.  I was also more than a bit terrified that my own phone book would be mostly blank when I grew up.</p>



<p>Today all phone numbers, email and addresses are stored in Google.  I don&#8217;t have a separate backup file, nor are they printed out.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s the more horrifying thing.</p>
