<p>If you&#8217;re done with billionaires deciding what information you read, there is a simple and effective way for you to take control of which digital content you want to consume.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s called RSS, and it&#8217;s a way for new content to get delivered direct from a publisher to your phone, with no middleman getting in the way.  This post is a step by step guide to setting up your phone with a few feeds and get you in a position to add more on your own.</p>



<p>You need to invest a small amount of time in setting it up, and change your habits away from big tech platforms.  But you&#8217;ll be rewarded with a stream of excellent content, tailored precisely to your taste and directly under your control.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is RSS?</h3>



<p>RSS is an easy way to keep up with the latest news, blogs, podcasts and other information from dozens and potentially hundreds of websites that you are interested in.</p>



<p>You do this with an RSS app (sometimes called RSS reader or RSS client) that stores your list of websites and automatically checks them on a regular basis. It then displays all the latest posts in a single stream, latest at the top.</p>



<p>You can browse through at your leisure, read the articles or ignore them.  There is no algorithm or advertising to interfere with your reading.  Doing this means you can <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/own-your-scroll/" data-type="post" data-id="690">own your own scroll</a> again.</p>



<p>The process of adding a website to your RSS app is called subscribing.  Don&#8217;t be put off by this term.  It is free, you don&#8217;t hand over any personal details and you can unsubscribe at any time.  In fact, the website you are following via RSS will have no idea that you are.</p>



<p>There are dozens of RSS apps for all phone and PC types.  However, in this article I will just mention two, one for apple and one for android.  Once you are comfortable with the whole RSS concept, you can easily switch your feeds to other apps if they offer better features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting an RSS app &#8211; Android</h3>



<p>If you have an android phone, here are the steps to get started (scroll down for iphone instructions). It&#8217;s probably easier to view this article on your phone so you can click the link to find the app and cut/paste the example feed links.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Goto the app store and search for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;pli=1">Feeder by NoNonsenseApps</a>.  There are a few with similar names so be careful.  Click on that link to check the app icons match.  Install the app.</li>



<li>After opening for the first time, you will see a blank screen and message &#8220;Nothing to read here&#8221;.  </li>



<li>Press the three dots in the top right, and select &#8220;+ Add feed&#8221; from the menu (third item down)</li>



<li>You are then asked to enter the feed URL.  A URL is just a website address which you usually cut and paste from the browser bar rather than type from scratch.</li>



<li>Enter a URL into the box by cut and pasting an address from step 9 below. Press the search box. A confirmation box should appear below the search button with the name of the feed. If you get an error, check that the URL is entered correctly.</li>



<li>Press the confirmation box and you will be taken to a list of settings for that page.  Press the &#8220;Fetch full article by default&#8221; switch to on.  All the other settings can remain the same.  Scroll down and press the save button to confirm the feed in your app.</li>



<li>You will then see a list of articles from that feed on your phone.  Clicking into any of them will allow you to see the full article.  If it says &#8220;read more on this topic&#8221; at the end, just click on the icon at the top with the three lines next to the feed title.  This shows the full entry.</li>



<li>You can now go back to step 3 and enter a new feed from the list in step 9.  Once you have a few in there, goto step 10.</li>



<li>For your first few feeds, choose some from the following list as an example to get you started.  You can always delete them later if you don&#8217;t want them in your feed (except mine &#8230; mine are awesome and should never be deleted).<br><br>Press the clipboard icon to copy the address to make it easier to paste into the app.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Once you have added a few, press the hamburger menu in the top left. This will show a menu with every individual feed you can go and read. If you click &#8220;All feeds&#8221; at the top, you will see a single feed with all the posts in reverse date order. This is the one I use the most, but if I want to check a particular website, you can select that and only see those posts.</li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s it!  </p>



<p>You now have a working RSS system on your phone.   Clicking on any article will open up the content in a window for you to read. An icon at the top will take you to the original website, if you wish to view it there.</p>



<p>You can adjust in the settings how often it refreshes.  The default is one hour, but I set mine to 6 hours &#8211; 4 times a day is enough for me to get new content.  I have no desire to check my phone constantly.</p>



<p>Once you have configured a few feeds and you can start to collect exactly which sites you want to personalise it exactly to your tastes. This leads nicely to the final topic:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do I find out the feed URL for a website?</h3>



<p>Most websites have RSS feeds (notable exceptions are social media) but not every website advertises it&#8217;s feed URL (indeed, some wordpress site owners may not even know they have RSS, which is enabled by default).</p>



<p>The simplest way to check if a website has a feed is to paste the home page website address into your reader.  If there is an obvious one, it will find it automatically.</p>



<p>If you come across an article you like on a website, copy the whole URL and try it in the reader &#8211; it will do it&#8217;s best to find the relevant feed for you if one exists.</p>



<p>Occasionally it might find more than one feed.  Usually the first one in the list is the one you want.  Sometimes comments are also offered as RSS feeds &#8211; there&#8217;s usually little point in following these unless you specifically want to.</p>



<p>If a website is complex (like the BBC example above), then it may have different feeds for different sections.  Here&#8217;s an example you might try for the business pages of the BBC website:</p>


<div class="copy-url-list"><div class="copy-url-item"><button class="copy-btn" data-url="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business">ðŸ“‹</button><span class="url-text">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business</span></div></div>
    <script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        const copyButtons = document.querySelectorAll(".copy-btn");
        copyButtons.forEach(button => {
            button.addEventListener("click", function() {
                const url = this.getAttribute("data-url");
                navigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {
                    alert("Copied to clipboard: " + url);
                }, function(err) {
                    console.error("Could not copy text: ", err);
                });
            });
        });
    });
    </script>



<p>If the above doesn&#8217;t work for your site, there are a few other tips and tricks for finding the RSS URL.  I&#8217;ll write a seperate blog post for this topic.</p>



<p>That ends the RSS Tutorial.  I hope you made it to the end and you now have a few feeds you can read on your phone instead of gorging on social media.  </p>



<p>I have over 600 feeds in my RSS reader, and that is my sole primary source of information.  Very occasionally I remove a feed that is no longer relevant, but I usually find myself adding more every week as I stumble across article links to new websites that I hadn&#8217;t seen before but want to follow.</p>



<p>I promise you that if you stick with RSS and customise it to your taste, your digital wellbeing will be 100% improved.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting an RSS app &#8211; iPhone</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have an iPhone so I can&#8217;t give step by step instructions.  However, you should be able to follow the sequence of steps above with an app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210">NetNewsWire</a> which is very similar to the one described above for android.</p>
