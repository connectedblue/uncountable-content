<p>Tracy has compiled a very good series of posts on <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/06/28/compromising-information/">connecting the indie web</a> that explores all the different ways human connection is supported and where it might all be heading next.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a long read, spread over posts written at different points in time, but the overarching argument is best summarised by this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--3">
<p>My wish is for the IndieWeb to <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/21/taking-opportunities-to-connect/">enable <em>and encourage</em> connection</a> between indie website publishers and readers, allowing conversations and <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/07/30/playing-together-online-reimagining-interactions/">other types of interaction</a>. My vision is strengthening and broadening the IndieWeb community. <strong>I want the IndieWeb to be a viable alternative to social media</strong>, gradually widening the audience beyond tech-savvy folks by making the tools easier to use and more reliable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My position on this has evolved recently and I currently view this blog as part of <a href="/independent-vs-indie-web">the independent web</a>.  I don&#8217;t want to boil the ocean with the full slate of indie web components.  Instead, all my effort on this website goes into two areas:  writing and the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/experimenting-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1156">reader experience</a>.  </p>



<p>Writing is the main thing, and I do this whenever I have the urge to unload what is in my head.  However, I don&#8217;t put these posts straight onto the home page &#8211; there are various categories and sections around this site where writing can fit.</p>



<p>The reader experience is where I do a little bit of activism.  I would prefer if people <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/id-rather-you-didnt-read-this/" data-type="post" data-id="558">read my work in RSS</a>, rather than directly on the website.  The two principle reasons for taking this stance are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>if you don&#8217;t already have an RSS reader, your digital life will be improved greatly <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/getting-started-with-rss/" data-type="post" data-id="1174">by getting one</a>.  Then you can read my posts and hundreds of others.</li>



<li>if you add me to your reader, then you are more likely to read more of my posts over the longer term.</li>
</ul>



<p>To support this approach, I&#8217;ve committed to readers that they will get a predictable experience.  One post per day at 6am UK, and possibly one other at 6pm occassionally.   Additionally, if you subscribe over RSS, you&#8217;ll get some additional content at the end of each post, and occasionally RSS only posts.</p>



<p>In the couple of months I&#8217;ve been doing this, I&#8217;ve noticed an increase in connection on both my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guest-book/" data-type="post" data-id="187">guest book</a> and over email.  I don&#8217;t feel at all like I&#8217;m blogging into a vacuum, so I will keep up this strategy for as long as I feel that way.</p>



<p>But if you want to see the indie web in all it&#8217;s glory, head over to Tracy&#8217;s post and start clicking on a few links &#8211; you&#8217;ll soon end up in a rich tapestry of human interaction  that you haven&#8217;t got a chance of experiencing if you never venture outside your favourite social media app.</p>
