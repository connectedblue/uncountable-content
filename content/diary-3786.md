<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>We left Arrowtown today for Dunedin.  Still pretty stiff from the canoing yesterday.  We didnt go the direct route to Dunedin, bit went along the southern scenic route instead via Invercargill right at the southern tip of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The weather wasn&#8217;t all that great so we didn&#8217;t get out at too many stops.  We stopped off at some waterfalls which were pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Got to Dunedin at around 7pm.   The cottage is amazing &#8211; best one yet.  We have a whole house in about an acre of grounds.  The house is brick and there is wood paneling everywhere inside.  The cottage is quite remote and up a hill and overlooks the long beach.  Lots of walks in the area to do.</div>
