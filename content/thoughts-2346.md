<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/ii-community">Interactive Investor</a> community member The Compounder, whose disciplined approach to investing over decades is about to pay dividends as he approaches imminent retirement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you â€¦ </h3>



<p>My background is pretty standard really, brought up by great parents who worked really hard, not a great deal of money but theyâ€™d bought their council house and we had new double glazed windows, we felt we were doing alright.</p>



<p>I had several part time jobs whilst at school and spent plenty but saved some and soon realised how easy it is for it to slip through your hands.&nbsp; It was through some of this part time work and watching my Dad work 7 days a week that I started to understand that working the hours was only part of the answer and that the other part was what job you do as well as what you do with your money.</p>



<p>University was all done on day release through and after an apprenticeship and the strong business/commercial focus of this was a help in forming some ideas on what might make a good investment.</p>



<p>Fast forward and Iâ€™m now 58, married now for 33 years (with two grown up daughters) to one of my school friends, I guess it started as a childhood crush.&nbsp; We have a shared history, a very open financial set up and a common view on money, which can only make for an easier situation in my mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>It started with some of the privatised shares (paper certificated and cheques in the post) and as soon as I was able to join the company pension I also took out a Free Standing AVCs through an IFA.</p>



<p>It was through this that I quickly understood what damage high charges were doing to the money I was investing and drew an early conclusion that IFAâ€™s were not a route I wanted to use and I wanted to be as self directed as I could with my investment and money choices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>Currently I would describe myself as an Income/Value investor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I try to keep some discipline in my investment selection and so I would like to think my approach is quite consistent.</p>



<p>I have an excel sheet (we all love them) that I have to complete as many of the selection hurdles as I can before I invest.&nbsp; That way I can assess the relative investment case across multiple options and it forces me to be able to record why I invest in something.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What % of take home income were you investing?</h3>



<p>It varied over time, with the peaks during/after the global financial crisis and then again over the last 10 years or so.</p>



<p>The peak would be around 40% but Iâ€™m a great believer in having balance in life and so there were times it was much lower.</p>



<p>So between 15% and 40%.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What was your approach to paying down the mortgage as well as investing?</h3>



<p>We went for a significantly bigger house when we were 40 and so had some heavy lifting to do over the last few years.Â </p>



<p>To start with I was very keen to have a good overpayment balance on the mortgage but after that was in place I definitely prioritised investing.</p>



<p>Like a lot of people, I have a simple balance sheet that shows our assets (investments &amp; home) vs debt (mortgage, when we had one) and my logic was that I would go for whatever drove the biggest positive in our net wealth.&nbsp; Ultimately that would get us to where we needed quicker and with tax relief and growth, investing always won out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On reflection this was the right decision, especially with compounding (you might guess where I got my ii handle from ðŸ™‚).</p>



<p>Ultimately though, I did need to pay my mortgage early and I did this through increasing payments and selling a few investments to pay it off.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>My money goal was to be financially independent and Iâ€™ve achieved that now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think my next goal is to really enjoy what it brings, manage it well, enjoy life and continue to enjoy investing..</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At what point did you realise the plan would deliver you early retirement?</h3>



<p>I think Iâ€™d known for the last 10 years.</p>



<p>I had a very solid plan before pension freedoms and so it was quite long term.</p>



<p>A key time was 5 years ago when my wife and myself discussed going for it then or working longer.&nbsp; We decided to work longer but do some of the things we planned in retirement&nbsp; whilst we worked a few more years.&nbsp; We didnâ€™t want to wish our lives away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We basically released some funds to do things like buy a camper van, go travellng more and get into the retirement mindset.</p>



<p>The longer run in has helped with further compounding (in fact those last few years do show the magic of compounding) and getting things in the right tax environments.</p>



<p>Everyone is different but overall, that was a good decision for us and I think we are very prepared both financially and mentally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Iâ€™m probably in a bit of an unusual situation as Iâ€™m sort of in both for this tax year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iâ€™m still working and so accumulating but Iâ€™m running my investments for the year in the way they are positioned to provide a yield income in retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think of it as a dry run year whilst I re-position a few assets in the most tax efficient way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>When we finish work next year I have the investments set up to produce the yield that we want to live a nice life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this years yield will be next years discretionary spend.</p>



<p>I do have cash and other safer investments but generally I am looking for the yield to provide the money.</p>



<p>Lastly, my plan is to be as tax efficient as I can with my income and so I use a combination of SIPP, ISA, GIA, VCT, Gilts, etc in both mine and my wifeâ€™s name to allow for a really tax efficient income.</p>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are you most looking forward to after retirement?</h3>



<p>Definitely more travelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We both like to be very active and keep fit and so really plan to double down on our health &amp; well being.</p>



<p>Like yourself, I love the outdoors and wildlife and plan a lot more of that as well as bagging some more Wainwrights &amp; Munros (hills in the Lake District &amp; Scotland)</p>



<p>I also just want to spend much more time with friends &amp; family.</p>



<p>Lastly, I want to give something back to society with a bit of volunteering.</p>



<p>So nothing much planned ðŸ˜‚</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>To be honest, Iâ€™ll take in any education on investing but the following are some of the ones that really help.</p>



<p>I listen to all of the Podcasts but to single my top three:-</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Personal Investor &#8211; Fidelity <a href="https://www.fidelity.co.uk/markets-insights/podcasts/?p=0&amp;c=10">Investment &amp; Finance Podcasts | MoneyTalk | Fidelity</a></li>



<li>Many Happy Returns <a href="https://pensioncraft.com/investor-education/resources/podcasts/">Podcasts</a></li>



<li>On the Money &#8211; ii <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/learn/ii-insights/ii-videos-podcasts/podcasts">Investment &amp; Finance Podcasts from ii &#8211; ii</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Iâ€™m not a huge fan of investing books but I will pick 3 that have influenced me a lot in my investing style:-</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Essays of Warren Buffett by Lawrence Cunningham</li>



<li>Investing Against the Tide by Anthony Bolton</li>



<li>Competitive Advantage by Micheal Porter (not an investment book but really helps establish how to identify a business with competitive advantage)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that youâ€™d like to hear other peopleâ€™s experience of in the ii community?</h3>



<p>I really like it when people say â€˜why they are investingâ€™ in something.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally the ii Community is a great place for open thought sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would&nbsp; encourage people to try and summarise why they buy what they do as it really helps you with your thought process and makes the decision process much more â€˜head than heartâ€™ based.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would equally like people to provide their thoughts on other peoples investments in as constructive a way as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I actually love it when people challenge me with some logic as I want to avoid any blind spots in my investing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only caveat I would put on this is that different people have different investment styles and so lets try and not criticise peoples style but comments about the specific investment are absolutely valuable.</p>



<p>There is a huge amount of experience in the ii Community and we all have a lot to learn and a lot to give.</p>
