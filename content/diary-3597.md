<p>Went down to the Library this morning to hold the last of three summer code clubs for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  The challenge this year was Sport, so in an hour and a half we had the challenge of building a sports website from scratch. </p>



<p>There were 6 children today which brings the total to 18 over the holidays who all have a live website on neocities.org with a two page content and design which they had come up with.</p>



<p>We were coding HTML and CSS pages &#8211; no wordpress or other shortcuts.  Despite the difficulties with typing precise code, they all amazed me with their creativity and persistence in creating a site.  They also added copyright friendly images from Getty and added youtube videos.</p>



<p>I think they all were inspired by actually having a web page they can put whatever they want on.  This is is whole point of the club &#8211; to inspire the next generation to explore digital creativity, and not just use computers to consume.</p>



<p>If you would like to get your child interested in coding websites, you are welcome to follow the simple <a href="https://dursleycodeclub.trinket.io/sports-website#/setting-up/set-up-neocities">course instructions outlined here</a>.  </p>
