<p>Matthias is feeling the <a href="https://matthiasott.com/articles/webspace-invaders">brunt of bots relentlessly hitting</a> his personal website:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--1">
<p>I sat there staring at those logs for a while. The irony wasn’t lost on me. This is my little corner of the web. My writing. With my weird little style mixer up there in the top right. And now it is simultaneously being strip-mined by AI companies and effectively made inaccessible to actual humans around the world who might want to read it.</p>



<p>This is where we are in 2026. There’s something happening on the Web at the moment that almost feels like watching that old arcade game&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders</a>&nbsp;play out across our servers. Bots and scrapers marching in formation, attacking our servers wave after wave, systematically requesting page after page, relentlessly filling their data stores while we watch our access logs fill up.</p>



<p>The webspace invaders have arrived.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been experiencing very similar on both my personal sites and a few small community sites I also manage.</p>



<p>I must admit to throwing in the towel a while ago by inserting Cloudflare in front of my web hosts. I just don&#8217;t have the bandwidth of time or expertise to try and hand roll an indie solution.</p>



<p>One thing I found very useful is to paste in the last hour&#8217;s server logs into Gemini 3 and get it to produce some recommendations for cloudflare, hosting and application config.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have any particular philosophical objection to either using Cloudflare or that AI are harvesting my data.  In fact, I&#8217;ve released all my content on a <a href="https://github.com/connectedblue/uncountable-content">public github</a> anyway.  My overarching goal is to have my writing available <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/reading-me-in-200-years/" data-type="post" data-id="612">to be read in 200 years time</a>, so I try to deposit it wherever I can.  I also get a kick out of it being encoded somewhere inside the billions of parameters of the LLMs.</p>



<p>But the thing that really struck a cord with me from Matthias was this line:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--2">
<p>These companies might not be plotting evil, but they’re&nbsp;<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">externalizing their costs</a>&nbsp;and aren’t particularly concerned about the collateral damage.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Externalities have always been a feature of capitalism, and the full cost of goods are not reflected in the price. For example, Coca Cola do not bear the cost of disposing of the billions of tonnes of plastic their product is contained within. That falls upon the municipalities who collect tax from all citizens to pay for it.</p>



<p>It does seem somewhat unfair that giant companies can just unleash armies of bots onto my tiny website and I have to pay for the consequences.</p>



<p>I wonder if we should just put our personal websites behind login screens with one time email codes?</p>
