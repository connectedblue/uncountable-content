Got up early due to a bit of jetlag, but set out to look around Queen Street, the main shopping area.</p>
<p>Bought a pair of very good hiking sandals each.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went to Devonport, a short ferry ride across from the auckland harbour.  Very pretty seaside village with clapperboard houses.  Lots of victorian style craft shops and restaurants.</p>
<p>Walked around the heritage trail and got the ferry back at around 5pm.</p>
<p>New Years Eve tonight.  We stayed in the apartment as we were still quite tired but got a great view of the fireworks from the apartment balcony.  New Zealand TV was showing the Graham Norton New Years Eve show from 2009!</p>
