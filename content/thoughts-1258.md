<p>Vixiss writes about <a href="https://vixiss.bearblog.dev/on-social-media-addiction/">social media addition</a> and three common reasons to put off trying to tackle it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--23">
<p>Since quitting traditional social media altogether, I have regained so much time in my day where I can spend on other meaningful endeavours like working on my career, learning a new language, or even starting a blog! Where I used to spend hours in a day just aimlessly scrolling and remembering none of it even five minutes later, I was now granted with an extra hour or two a day to actually spend my time on things that make for a more fulfilling life.</p>

<p>He uses a word which can be applied to many aspects of life: intentional. Be very specific about the purpose you are undertaking an activity. I often use it when <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/money/">talking about money</a>, but it equally applies to social media usage.</p>



<p>Starting a blog is an excellent way to deal with this because there&#8217;s an amount of upfront friction to overcome &#8230; what does the blog look like, how will I organise it, what will I write about etc.  All these things are provided in a simple framework on social media so you don&#8217;t have to think.</p>



<p>Once you are intentional about your digital life, the outcomes will be more rewarding.  I left LinkedIn about two years ago (the only social media I&#8217;ve participated in on a regular basis) and started blogging a year or so ago.</p>



<p>For me, <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/contact-me/" data-type="post" data-id="218">receiving an email</a>, comment or <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/guest-book/" data-type="post" data-id="187">guestbook entry</a> from someone who has read my blog is worth a thousand views/likes on social media.</p>



<p>And occasionally, in my RSS reader, I&#8217;ll stumble across someone who has linked to a post of mine from their blog.  That is incredibly uplifting, because you realise that we are not all typing into a lonely void.  There is a community out there having a global conversation in a considered and welcoming way.  </p>



<p>Try getting that from your social media feed.</p>
