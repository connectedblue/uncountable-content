<p>The annual summer walk with <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> where we return to a site worked on over the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/winter-habitat-management-2024-25/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="48">winter habitat management season</a>.  The location today was a stunning SSSI site where we did a huge amount of <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/02/uncovering-new-grassland/" data-type="post" data-id="4275">gorse and scrub removal</a> back in February.</p>



<p>It was nice to meet up with the team again &#8211; we are not used to seeing each other without winter clothing.  Today was scorching weather, and no work involved, just a pleasant walk down to the bank to take a look at what&#8217;s growing.</p>

<p>I always find it satisfying to go back to sites in the summer and see what a difference the work makes.  This one in particular was hard work as we had to remove a large amount of encroaching gorse from a steep bank.  </p>



<p>Most of the areas were starting to see grass return, although, of course, gorse shoots are still coming through.  But hopefully with grazing those young shoots don&#8217;t develop.</p>



<p>There were several areas of bare earth though where the grass hadn&#8217;t returned.  Anna thought maybe we could do a green hay cut onto those areas to encourage growth next year (but this needs to be checked as it&#8217;s a SSSI).</p>



<p>We also managed to identify a plant that was spotted in February but couldn&#8217;t be sure what it was.  </p>

<p>It turned out to be Houndstongue which is a reasonably rare plant.  Very large too and doesn&#8217;t look like a typical calcareous grassland herb.</p>



<p>Cerian was keeping tally of all the species, and although we haven&#8217;t done the final tally yet, I wouldn&#8217;t at all be surprised if it&#8217;s over 100.  Indicator species alone was pretty extensive.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I attended my first meeting of the <a href="https://www.creategloucestershire.co.uk/cam-dursley-creatives">Cam &amp; Dursley Creatives</a>.  This group has been going since 2019 apparently, but I only heard of them last week.  It&#8217;s a six weekly gathering of various creative projects in the area, where they try and collaborate on getting projects delivered.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a pot of money they call the &#8220;community chest&#8221; which anyone can make a bid for small amounts from, and if it&#8217;s approved by the group, it gets awarded and the results reported back.  So I made a pitch for some AI funding for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> which was received well enough for me to make an application for consideration next time.</p>



<p>In the evening, we held the <a href="https://dursleygreen.org.uk/dursley-green-drinks/">Dursley Green Drinks</a> at Kingshill House.  Very well attended tonight, possibly due to the fabulous evening weather.  But new people as well which is always nice to see.  A good opportunity to catch up with others on various strands of projects I&#8217;ve been doing.</p>
