<p>It was the second session on the introduction to web programming at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  I went down to the library in the afternoon to set everything up.  We also had secured some books on HTML which interested children could borrow on their card if they wished to explore more.</p>



<p>Six of the eight PCs were filled today.  Five returning from last week and one new person.  They continued to build out their websites, adding images this week.  I&#8217;m definitely impressed with the way they explore and experiment with the web page layouts to create their own content.</p>



<p>One child even had moved onto the CSS file and figured out how to style the page without any prompting or input from me.  Pretty smart children of Dursley!</p>
