<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Left Konini cottage at 7.45am to head down for the ferry.   Got there in plenty of time for the 10/25am sailing.  The voyage across was very picturesque, especially as we got towards the south island and sailed for about two hours down the inlets.</p>
<p>The drive from Picton to Westport was stunning.  The scenery in the North Island was great, but the south island is something else.  We drove for around 4 hours down a single road and there is nothing for miles except mountain ranges and gorges.  We both shared the driving as it was a long haul.</p>
<p>Stopped off for a cup of tea in Merchant when we noticed it was actually around 22C &#8211; very hot and much better than the forecasts.  Going towards Westport after that we had a bit of a scare when the fuel guage showed empty and the light was flashing (there was no petrol station for miles).  But after a while it went back up to half full, so not sure what the problem was.</p>
<p>The Lazy Seal cottage is really nice &#8211; the biggest we have stayed in yet.  It&#8217;s in a rural location and there&#8217;s lots to see and do over the next few days. </div>
