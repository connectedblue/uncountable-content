<p>This question is inspired by James, who wrote that he wished a cohesive list of <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/04/13/what-we-see-in-our-websites">reasons for starting a website</a> existed.</p>



<p>If you have a personal website, please feel free to add yours to the list and why you started it!</p>

					<div class="gb-entry-content">I started my website because I wanted a home on the internet to publish my words on my own terms.<br />
<br />
With my website, I could write and publish long-form blog posts, on a page that was designed by me (or at least customised by me). Long-form is the style of writing I wanted to do, but one that social media platforms didn&#039;t embrace.<br />
<br />
I also built my website to tinker with code. I enjoyed building with the web; figuring out how different elements made up a web page, playing with design, making pages, connecting those pages together.<br />
<br />
These are the abridged reasons why I started my website, but another question now comes to mind: Why do I keep going? I love writing. I love the web.

					<div class="gb-entry-content">This blog was started so I could share business startup, marketing, and design knowledge. I have a lot stored in documents that were serving no one tucked away in my computer or mind. It gives me a way to listen for what people are struggling with and try to put something together that can help them. Most of what I share here is comprehensive in nature, not too many short reads yet, but I do plan to include more subtext and brief content to augment some easy to digest bites. It&#039;s a process.

					<div class="gb-entry-content">I started my personal blog in order to be more intentional about creating and sharing. I enjoy writing but don&#039;t enjoy the 15 second attention suck social media scene. I create a lot of art and poetry as well, and it&#039;s a much better experience on a blog. Also having a blog is helping me narrow down. It sort of forces you to think in terms of category and purpose, which is very helpful. I&#039;d like to say I started with a perfect idea of what it would be, but honestly that&#039;s not how it&#039;s gone for me. I knew the reasons, but not yet the purpose of the blog. Thankfully there&#039;s room to grow. I keep learning and that&#039;s always a good thing.
