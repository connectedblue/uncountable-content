<p>Heather has <a href="https://heatherandbone.com/virtual-art-swap-digital-identity/">come up with a brilliant idea</a> for a community collaboration on <a href="https://artocalypse.org">the Artocalypse</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--43">
<p>July 1 – We start our digital painting! This day is for guiding and shaping the future of the piece while letting go of absolutely any and all expectations. There is a two-hour time limit that can be broken up into any increments you like but only add what you feel inspired to add. Flatten to one layer, write a post about it, add relevant links, and add your piece to the form I send.</p>



<p>July 2 – receive piece from another artist, repeat day 1 by spending up to two hours adding to the artist’s creative vision and upload to form. Make sure to blog about it! Hoping for your reasoning and motivation of what you added.</p>



<p>July 3-7 Repeat – Each artist will receive a digital copy of each collaborative art piece and is encouraged to write about how the experience was and if they would do it again. Each piece will contribute to The Artocalypse Digital Identity Expo along with all pieces inspired by or informed by the theme by members!</p>

<p>The Artocalypse follows indieweb principles for artists.  The idea is to post on your own site and share your creative journey with the community and the wider world.  But all the posts are also syndicated via RSS onto the artocalypse home page.  So there is a community presence without requiring a central platform to login to. </p>



<p>The interesting thing about this expo is that each artist works and publishes on their own, but they jointly produce a collaboration.</p>
