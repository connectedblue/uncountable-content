<p>Months can go by without me going through the Slad valley, but in the last few weeks I&#8217;ve had three activities there, in different parts.  Today we were with <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a> in a beautiful set of meadows in the upper part of Slad valley.</p>



<p>The original plan was to run two harvesters for two days and get as much as possible from the 13ha site.  But on the way over this morning, Tom&#8217;s Landrover broke down so he had to re-dedicate the day to getting it fixed and arranging another vehicle.</p>



<p>So there were four of us with Lorna &#8211; a bit over staffed for the day.  Sarah went home and will return tomorrow, while Andy, John and I stayed to deal with the output from today.</p>

<p>The condition of the site was incredible. The farmer visited and told us how he managed it.</p>



<p>After the seed turns, he puts on cattle for a while to chomp it down a bit.  Then he tops the field, leaving the clippings on.  Then the cows go back on for the rest of the winter.</p>

<p>Finally, towards April he has sheep grazing on it so that the sward is cut down to almost a bowling green finish.  Then it&#8217;s left over the summer to flower.  It&#8217;s an arable reversion of about 30 years, and he&#8217;s been managing that way for years.  The grass was really not tall, and it was packed with herbs.  The yellow rattle was mostly in seed, but we were able to pick up all sorts of seeds with the harvester brush set low.</p>



<p>Although there were three of us, we were not really idle.  Lorna kept returning sooner and sooner as the hopper quickly filled.  It would have been a pretty hard slog if there were just two of us.</p>



<p>There was also a bit of extra repair work needed on the truck.  Lorna had bought some fine mesh and velcro pads to cover up the vents on the front to stop the seed blowing in and clogging around the radiator.  It took a couple of goes, but eventually it made a pretty good seal, and the engine was pretty seed free in the afternoon.</p>



<p>Filled four ton bags by the end of the day. If we had been running two harvesters, I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;d have put the extra seed. I reckon another 60kg haul in all.</p>
