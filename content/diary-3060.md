<p>I&#8217;ve not been to the <a href="https://www.crickhowellfestival.com/">Crickhowell Walking Festival</a> since before COVID (when it was the very last thing I did before Boris ordered us to stay at home).  It&#8217;s good to get back in the habit, so we grabbed some tickets for the final weekend and rented a cottage in nearby Llangynidr for the week.</p>



<p>The journey over is easy now that there is no more M4 toll and can leave during the day to beat the commuter crowd.  The cottage was very well appointed and stocked (although the internet was just about the most unstable you could imagine).  It&#8217;s situated in a good walking spot so there wouldn&#8217;t be much need for the car.</p>
