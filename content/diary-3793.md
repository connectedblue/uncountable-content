<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Weather much better today.  We set off to do some local bush walks to the south.</p>
<p>First stop was Ship&#8217;s creek where you can see New Zealand&#8217;s tallest trees.  Then it was off to monro Beach which is reached by about an hour of bush walking.  Once you get there, there is a fantastic beach hidden away with wild surf.</p>
<p>We then started to do the Haast cattle track path, but gave up after a bit because the ground was very boggy underfoot and we only had trainers on. </div>
