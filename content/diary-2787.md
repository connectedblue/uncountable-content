<p>I am sat at table height, presumably in a high chair.  I can see the table under the window and three people sat around it having tea.  Two are my mum and dad, and the other was my maternal nanna.</p>



<p>They are playing with the HP sauce bottle, unscrewing the cap and banging the end but nothing is coming out.  They pass it to each other to try.</p>
