<p>Met at Fromebridge with the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a> for my first &#8220;Fromebridge Friday&#8221; winter project.  The overall objective is to put in stock proof fencing along the river banks where we have <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2024/09/riparian-restoration/" data-type="post" data-id="3621">created water vole habitats</a> in the past.  This will protect them from grazing cattle and leave them undisturbed.</p>



<p>There were a couple of extra jobs that needed doing to support canal work though.  The first was the removal of an old compost bin from the middle of some willows which will have significant tree work done in the next fortnight.   It potentially was home to some over wintering wildlife, so we wanted to carefully remove it before the main contractors start work.</p>



<p>Caroline, Clare and I spent the first hour cutting through access and locating the bin.  As it happens, there was nothing inside &#8211; the compost had set like a firm brick, and we could just safely remove and destroy it.</p>



<p>After a break with three delicious cakes to choose from (although I didn&#8217;t choose, I sampled a slice of all three), I headed back to occupation bridge to help out Rene and Susie with a removal of an ash tree by the canal edge. The tree has dieback and is also obstructing where scaffolding needs to be erected shortly to restore the bridge.</p>



<p>It was a multi-stemmed ash, and Rene had cut the first few into the canal.  We then had some bigger stems which we managed to fell onto the bank side and trim down.  The real fun and games started when trying to retrieve the felled trunks from the canal.</p>

<p>We had some long &#8220;shepherd hooks&#8221; to haul them in, but one broke and fell into the canal. By then, the laughter and antics had attracted Lisa and Suzi who came over to see what was happening.</p>



<p>With the extra hands, we hatched a new plan to go on the other side of the canal and haul them out that way.  </p>



<p>By now we also attracted an audience of cows, one of whom comically poked his head round underneath the bridge to stare at us.</p>



<p>Somehow we did manage to drag everything out without falling in.</p>

<p>By this point we stopped for lunch and went to admire the actual progress made on the other side of the field by the fencing team, who had added many more posts along the canal bank.</p>



<p>It was a day of fantastic weather, cake and banter.  Maybe next week I might get some fencing done as well.</p>
