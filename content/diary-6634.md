<p>This morning was the regular quarterly meeting of the <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a> steering group and a chance to thrash out the 2026 campaign.   We have secured some funding to do some artwork and printing, but the main themes need to be finalised.</p>



<p>A small group of us will meet with Leah on Thursday to hopefully shape the &#8220;26 things to do in &#8217;26&#8221; list and we can then start pulling together content.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I met up with Vicky and Martin at the sports field to go through the habitat management plan on behalf of the pavilion committee.  We will essentially cut and rake an area to stimulate wild flowers and also do some tree planting.  This should make a good winter project for the Uley Trees &amp; Meadows group.</p>



<p>In the evening I caught up on zoom with Keith and Joe who I <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/1990/09/first-day-of-work/" data-type="post" data-id="3632">started work with back in 1990</a>.  They all recently had a reunion which I unfortunately couldn&#8217;t attend, so it was nice to catch up with them and hear about their current lives.  There may well be other reunions in the next year or so as retirements start to get scheduled.</p>
