<p>Please remember I am not a financial advisor, and these are simply my perspectives after 25 years of investing.  Your journey and considerations will differ from mine.</p>



<p>However, I do believe you should ask yourself all these questions and formulate answers relevant to yourself.  Your financial outcomes will be improved if you are intentional with your decisions.</p>



<p>If you want to explore more on this topic, you can read a fuller <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/a-reading-list-for-investing/">set of articles on investing</a> here.</p>



<p>I welcome feedback from this little &#8220;mini-series&#8221;.  It was an experiment this week to present content to you in a different way, and hopefully get you thinking about money in new ways.  </p>



<p>Please send me an email on <a href="mailto:chris@uncountable.uk">chris@uncountable.uk</a> with your thoughts on these topics, or anything else you&#8217;d like me to cover in future.</p>
