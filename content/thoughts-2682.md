<p>Once in drawdown there is a strategy called <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/draining-and-recycling-the-sipp/" data-type="post" data-id="2217">draining the SIPP</a> which optimises tax efficiency over many years by fully utilising annual tax allowances that would otherwise expire.</p>



<p>You can see the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/draining-and-recycling-the-sipp/" data-type="post" data-id="2217">details of the approach here</a>, but basic idea is to move investments from the restrictive SIPP wrapper to ISA where they can be used flexibly in future without any taxation penalty.</p>



<p>I first deployed this method in April 2025, and the whole process took about 8-10 weeks (including the P55 tax reclaim). For a part of that I was &#8220;out of market&#8221; while funds got sold from the SIPP, paid out as income, and then re-invested back into ISA. The exact same investment was bought in the ISA as was sold from the SIPP, so no overall portfolio change (aside from the price differential).</p>



<p>However, there are a couple of optimisations I will make in the next tax year which will improve the long term portfolio strategy:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Buy the ISA on the same day as selling the SIPP to avoid being out of market.</li>



<li>Sell FTSE100 from the SIPP and rebuy S&amp;P500 in the ISA.</li>
</ul>



<p>The first point is really just short term cash flow management. I keep a <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">four year expenses cash/mmf pot</a>, so I&#8217;ll &#8220;borrow&#8221; from that to make the ISA purchase on the same day, and it will be repaid when the money lands from the SIPP payroll and P55 refund a few weeks later.</p>



<p>That removes the risk of markets moving up and down, and also concentrates all the associated admin to one day so less chance of error.</p>



<p>The second point of selling one type of asset and buying another looks a bit odd on first glance &#8211; tilting the portfolio balance for no reason.  However when you zoom out and look at the household portfolio strategy (two people with six accounts across ISA, SIPP and Trading) it makes a bit more sense.</p>



<p>Back in 2022, I split the overall household equity portfolio into <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/us-and-uk-portfolio-allocation/" data-type="post" data-id="1878">60:40 UK:US index</a> accumulating trackers. One of the reasons for the higher percentage in FTSE100 was that I intended to draw down those until around 2040 or so, and keep the US as a long term investment.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still happy with this approach, and one reason why I&#8217;m utterly unconcerned with all the talk of over-valuation, AI bubbles or Trump tariffs.  Today&#8217;s news headlines will be irrelevant by the early 2040s when I will need to start drawing down those investments.</p>



<p>However, from a practical perspective, my aim is to drain the SIPP over many years &#8211; perhaps as many as 20.  So I won&#8217;t be drawing any funds at all from ISA for day to day expenses (I may do for large discretionary spend, but that&#8217;s a different issue).</p>



<p>So really the ISA is the long term pot, and all new money there should get put into long term investments &#8211; currently S&amp;P500. When the FTSE100 pot gets to zero in the SIPP, I can then just do the sell/buy transaction purely on the S&amp;P part of the SIPP and drain that.</p>



<p>All this, of course, is based on the current regulations and advantages.  The whole approach may be revisited if a future chancellor changes the rules.</p>
