<p>Today is  <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a>. It occurs twice a year on the longest and shortest day and is a chance for volunteers to reflect on the list of things they do, and decide if some changes need to be made to prevent them burning out.</p>



<p>I volunteer with several organisations. It&#8217;s a really important way to get <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">structure, identity and purpose</a> after you stop work. But it can get overwhelming. There are just so many interesting things to get involved with, it&#8217;s easy to over commit.</p>



<p>I found out about this day last year and found it a great way to constantly review what I do and not to be afraid to drop something if necessary. This is my third review.</p>



<p>I made quite a few changes <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/winter-solstice-2024-volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/" data-type="post" data-id="1907">in my last update</a>, so these have been bedding in over the last few months. I&#8217;ve spent a fair bit of time working on the launch of <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/">Discover Dursley</a> , increasing the amount of riverfly activity across the community and getting the Glorious Grasslands survey app ready for the new season.</p>



<p>One interesting change has been how i do activities with <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>.  They introduced a new booking system, and as a result I&#8217;ve been doing work parties across many different reserves.  This is to explore other different opportunities when my Fromebridge projects gradually come to an end during this year.</p>



<p>I also ramped up my involvement with Stroud Wildlife Survey group and led two activities in the 2025 programme.</p>



<p>I decided to remove occasional items from this list because they don&#8217;t represent a big pull on my time, and I haven&#8217;t attended them for some time.</p>



<p>So, here is my current list of volunteering activities that reflect the above and other changes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Volunteer organising</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dursley Code Club</li>



<li>Dursley Green Drinks/Hub</li>



<li>Riverfly Monitoring at three sites</li>



<li>Small mammal river monitoring</li>



<li>Stroud Wildlife Survey Group</li>



<li>Glorious Grasslands survey data</li>



<li>The Artocalypse</li>



<li>Discover Dursley Website</li>



<li>Uley Trees and Meadows</li>



<li>People &amp; Money</li>



<li>Retirement Zoom Group call</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Volunteer participation</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Glorious Grasslands Habitat management/Seed Harvesting</li>



<li>GWT Canal group</li>



<li>Pockett&#8217;s Orchard work party</li>



<li>SVP Canal group</li>



<li>Discover Dursley</li>



<li>SVP Tree group</li>
</ul>



<p>This list, while quite long, is way more manageable than when I first did this exercise a year ago.  Having this amnesty day in the calendar has really helped me keep control and perspective on my volunteering activities.</p>
