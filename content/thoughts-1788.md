<p>Two traits have been pretty central to how I organise my life: least friction and concerned curiosity.</p>



<p>Least friction means I take the path that will cause me least resistance.  It&#8217;s not just about avoiding confrontation (although I generally do that) it&#8217;s also about not expending energy on things I cannot change.</p>



<p>For example, if I&#8217;m presented with a process for obtaining something that is weird, long-winded or pointless, I first assess how much I want the thing.  If it&#8217;s not that much, then I just get on with something else.  If I do desperately want that something, then I get as clear an understanding as I can about all the steps and do them.  I don&#8217;t bother arguing about why they are needed, or make back handed comments about the situation.</p>



<p>I just seek the path of least friction that gets me the thing.</p>



<p>Concerned curiosity is about expanding my knowledge in areas of interest.  I have little to no interest in almost all human activity and endeavour.   In those cases, I am happy to accept the decisions of others on a good faith basis.</p>



<p>For example, it&#8217;s very difficult to book a GP appointment at the moment in the UK.  I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea why, but I&#8217;m happy to accept that it&#8217;s not because GPs are lazy.  I&#8217;m not really motivated enough to dive into the ins and outs of front line health provision to understand the reasons why.  </p>



<p>The circle of concern and circle of influence has been a central filter in my life since the mid 90s.  I have a bunch of things that I am concerned about, and a smaller set of things I can influence.  </p>



<p>Everything outside that are things I&#8217;m aware of, but unconcerned about (e.g. music trends) and of course things that I&#8217;m not aware of (almost everything).</p>



<p>Expanding my circle of influence has been an ongoing quest since leaving university (and finding myself in a position of zero influence).  The way I do this is to try and acquire as much knowledge as possible about things I am concerned about.  This is concerned curiosity.</p>



<p>I do this on multiple fronts, and without really knowing how it might affect my influence.  Most things I do not acquire knowledge about do not increase my influence on anything.  However, where I have manged to exert a small influence on something, it is almost always due to a unique combination of seemingly unrelated things I happen to have observed.</p>



<p>My primary areas of concern at the moment are wildlife habitats, digital technology, mathematics, astronomy, economics, capitalism and history.  Secondary areas of concern are politics, geography, psychology and  energy. </p>



<p>There are obviously a lot of other factors that go into organising day to day existence, but the twin pillars of least friction and concerned curiosity are the enduring principles that help me navigate.</p>
