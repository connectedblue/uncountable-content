<p>Early start to meet Susie at Lister Road for the monthly riverfly count.  The river levels were strikingly low &#8211; literally not even up to ankles, but it seemed to be flowing faster which was odd.</p>



<p>The first thing we noticed was Blue-winged olives everywhere.  More than gammarus which is incredible.  So after a while we didn&#8217;t collect and just estimated the number.  After a while though, we got the eye in for other species and found regular olives as well.</p>



<p>Overall a score of 8 which is perhaps a bit on the low side for this site, but still very respectable.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, the second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> of the week down at the library.  Another new volunteer today, who is on a break from University.  Today, the children were very quiet, just getting on with their projects, and not really too many questions.</p>
