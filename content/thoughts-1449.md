<p>Look up at any horse chestnut in the UK during August and you&#8217;ll see a sad sight. Most leaves will be blotchy, more will be missing and brown leaves will have fallen to the floor.</p>



<p>Pretty much every horse chestnut is infected with the leaf mining moth &#8211; a non-native invasive species introduced in the last 20 years or so.</p>



<p>The leaves and flowers come out as normal early in the year, but then the moths from the previous cycle crawl up the trunk and lay eggs on the leaves &#8211; which causes the brown blotchiness that look like autumn. The leaves fall, dropping the larvae into the soil to repeat the process several times a season.</p>



<p>Remarkably it doesn&#8217;t harm the tree too much. It will continue to grow, although of course, losing leaves early is not great for it&#8217;s ability to produce food for itself.</p>



<p>It is devastating for young trees though &#8211; the moth will actually kill the horse chestnut. So in 100 years or so, when the current horse chestnuts are end of life, there&#8217;ll be no more conkers in the UK.</p>



<p>There are not too many practical solutions that can prevent this at the moment.  Clearing leaves wouldn&#8217;t really help, because just leaving a few behind will cause the whole cycle to repeat anyway.</p>



<p>There are not too many broad leafed deciduous trees in the UK.  Ash is already suffering from dieback.  Oaks around London are starting to be infested with the processionary moth.  Horse chestnut are blighted with leaf mining moths. In the US, beech leaf disease caused by a small nematode is killing millions of trees.  So far, it&#8217;s not been detected here, but it&#8217;s expected to only be a matter of time.</p>



<p>Our landscape could look very different in 100 years.</p>
