<p>Met up with Graham at 9am for our regular riverfly check at the Ocean. Given the poor informal samples I had <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/07/primary-school-riverfly/" data-type="post" data-id="6221">taken last week with Leonard Stanley school</a>, I wasn&#8217;t holding out too much hope.</p>



<p>And indeed, it was clear pretty quickly that the count was very low.  Hardly any gammarus &#8211; less than ten which is remarkable.  But we did actually find examples of three other species, which meant the overall score was 4 and did not trigger.  </p>



<p>This is a good example of how perhaps the individual counts tell more of a story than the score. What was, a month ago, a site of abundance,  harboured hardly any life at all today.</p>
