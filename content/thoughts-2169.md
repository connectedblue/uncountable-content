<p>I have been holding a series of interviews with people about money &#8230; their attitude towards it, goals and sharing some of their financial journey.</p>



<p>Of course, everyone&#8217;s experience is different and unique to them.  This is what has made it fascinating &#8230; there are so many ways to approach this thing that we all need.</p>



<p>You can read a selection of quotes below and if one piques your interest, click through and read the full interview.</p>


<section class="p-and-m-summary"><article><h2>Mattw321</h2><p>I joined the Army in 1993, turning 19, and was soon deployed abroad gaining much experience, but also some extra wages &ndash; disposable income, which I started to save and invest.&nbsp; Deployed overseas on operations attracted extra pay.&nbsp; I started putting money into shares using Charles Schwab Europe in 1996.&#8239;&nbsp;</p><p>I was in Northern Ireland for the unfortunate Lisburn Barracks bombings of 1996.&nbsp; Unfortunate events shortly afterwards led to near death (thanks Garth), and about a year in medical facilities.&#8239; But investing continued, I bought my first (buy-to-let), flat in 1999, alongside investment in stocks online. &#8239;They tended to be risky and profitable single stocks, but large losses were also involved.&nbsp;</p>

I&rsquo;m in my mid-thirties, I live in San Diego, California with my wife and daughter - and I currently work at Google as an engineering manager focused on improving company-wide engineering productivity.</p><p>I grew up outside of the United States - in a small rural town in Russia. I grew up with my mom - we weren&rsquo;t particularly well off nor did we want for anything - and my mom&rsquo;s approach to finance influenced my views. My mom was (she&rsquo;s well, but retired) an accountant who survived the USSR breakup, numerous currency changes, multiple recessions and currency inflation - the financial landscape was marred by instability. Probably because of that, my mom is very frugal and deliberate with money.</p>
<a href="/people-and-money-ruslan-osipov">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>Deflationary boom</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a 45 year old ex-fund manager. People would always mis-hear my profession as &lsquo;Fun manager&rsquo; or &lsquo;Farm manager&rsquo; in a desperate attempt to latch on to something that a) they could understand and b) didn&rsquo;t bore them senseless. I didn&rsquo;t find being a Fund Manager boring but it was very stressful and after twenty years of it I burnt out. I am now a Farm Manager.</p>
<a href="/people-and-money-deflationary-boom">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>DavidUK</h2><p>I am 47 years old. I grew up in New Zealand and started my career as a Management Consultant. For the last 18 years I have been fortunate to work within London&rsquo;s financial services sector. It&rsquo;s been a tough gig but I have met some awesome people and learnt a lot about life and the world from them.</p><p>I have always had a prudent attitude to money - &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend what you don&rsquo;t have and make sure you have some put away for a rainy day!&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="/people-and-money-daviduk">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>MJL</h2><p>I got my degree and PhD in Engineering from Oxford, spent 20 years in global manufacturing roles in FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 companies up to global VP level, then for the last 6 years worked at a Russell Group University, advising on commercialisation as a Professor of Practice.&nbsp;</p><p>I have just retired at 52 (actually down to a 1% contract - see later). My husband is 58 and retires in 3 months. We have two kids; one in their 2nd year at Uni and the other going to Uni later this year.</p>

<a href="/people-and-money-aah">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>uncountable</h2><p>I&rsquo;m 56 and retired in 2019, aged 51.&nbsp; I worked in a variety of technology roles in different industries, but latterly I was a data scientist for a renewable energy company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since stopping work, I have completely restructured my lifestyle around 5-6 nature recovery projects across the Cotswolds and three community projects in my local town.&nbsp; I managed to have a 29 year first career, and I&rsquo;m five years into what I very much hope is a second 29 year career focused on community and conservation.</p>
<a href="/people-and-money-uncountable">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>The Compounder</h2><p>My background is pretty standard really, brought up by great parents who worked really hard, not a great deal of money but they&rsquo;d bought their council house and we had new double glazed windows, we felt we were doing alright.</p><p>I had several part time jobs whilst at school and spent plenty but saved some and soon realised how easy it is for it to slip through your hands.&nbsp; It was through some of this part time work and watching my Dad work 7 days a week that I started to understand that working the hours was only part of the answer and that the other part was what job you do as well as what you do with your money.</p>
<a href="/people-and-money-the-compounder">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>Andrew1972</h2><p>I am just about to turn 53.&nbsp; I have been working in the financial services industry for over 30 years in a number of roles (mostly Risk related).&nbsp; I am married and my husband and I have no children.&nbsp; To me, money provides a mechanism for experiences and funding a comfortable life.&nbsp; I want my money to work for me and when I die, I want to have spent it all.</p>
<a href="/people-and-money-andrew1972">Read full interview...</a></article><article><h2>DeltaD</h2><p>I built a career working globally, promoting British businesses abroad and in the last 10 years of my career I worked in Digital Operations (International) for a large US Medical Insurance company.</p><p>Became financially independent at the age of 50. Now, my investments pay for my expenses and more. I have always been a saver, always look for true value when spending on anything and very much in favour of living below means.</p>
