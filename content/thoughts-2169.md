<p>I have been holding a series of interviews with <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/people-and-money/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="67">people about money</a> &#8230; their attitude towards it, goals and sharing some of their financial journey.</p>



<p>Of course, everyone&#8217;s experience is different and unique to them.  This is what has made it fascinating &#8230; there are so many ways to approach this thing that we all need.</p>



<p>You can read a selection of quotes below and if one piques your interest, click through and read the full interview.  Or browse the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/people-and-money/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="67">full list here</a>.</p>


<section class="p-and-m-summary"><article><h2>Deflationary boom</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a 45 year old ex-fund manager. People would always mis-hear my profession as &lsquo;Fun manager&rsquo; or &lsquo;Farm manager&rsquo; in a desperate attempt to latch on to something that a) they could understand and b) didn&rsquo;t bore them senseless. I didn&rsquo;t find being a Fund Manager boring but it was very stressful and after twenty years of it I burnt out. I am now a Farm Manager.</p>

I grew up in New Zealand and started my career as a Management Consultant. For the last 18 years I have been fortunate to work within London&rsquo;s financial services sector. It&rsquo;s been a tough gig but I have met some awesome people and learnt a lot about life and the world from them.</p><p>I have always had a prudent attitude to money - &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend what you don&rsquo;t have and make sure you have some put away for a rainy day!&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

The mantra of &lsquo;looking after the pennies&rsquo; was drilled into me constantly. </p><p>I graduated with a mediocre finance/accountancy degree but knew immediately that I didn&rsquo;t want to be an accountant. I changed jobs frequently before eventually becoming a building society manager, mortgage broker, estate agent and then finally a bookkeeper/financial controller for that estate agent. </p>

I&rsquo;m in my mid-thirties, I live in San Diego, California with my wife and daughter - and I currently work at Google as an engineering manager focused on improving company-wide engineering productivity.</p><p>I grew up outside of the United States - in a small rural town in Russia. I grew up with my mom - we weren&rsquo;t particularly well off nor did we want for anything - and my mom&rsquo;s approach to finance influenced my views. My mom was (she&rsquo;s well, but retired) an accountant who survived the USSR breakup, numerous currency changes, multiple recessions and currency inflation - the financial landscape was marred by instability. Probably because of that, my mom is very frugal and deliberate with money.</p>

Commenced employment in an engineering apprenticeship then progressed to engineer with a distance learning engineering degree.</p><p>Energy industry role has taken me on international assignments either rotational (28 days on / 28 days off) or accompanied assignments with my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
