<p>Today is  <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a>. It occurs twice a year on the longest and shortest day and is a chance for volunteers to reflect on the list of things they do, and decide if some changes need to be made to prevent them burning out.</p>



<p>I volunteer with several organisations and within the community. It&#8217;s a really important way to get <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/replacing-work-benefits/" data-type="post" data-id="413">structure, identity and purpose</a> after you stop work. But it can get overwhelming. There are just so many interesting things to get involved with, it&#8217;s easy to over commit.</p>



<p>Since finding out about this day in 2024 I&#8217;ve found it a great way to constantly review what I do and not to be afraid to drop something if necessary. This is my <a href="/topic/volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/">fourth review</a>.</p>



<p>There have been some minor changes <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/summer-solstice-2025-volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/" data-type="post" data-id="1907">since my last update</a>.  I&#8217;ve stopped doing the fortnightly small mammal raft monitoring for the <a href="https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/volunteer">Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust</a>. I also deleted my profile on the ii community app, so I no longer organise the zoom calls or conduct interviews.</p>



<p>Although neither of these took up great amounts of time, it&#8217;s good to keep intentionally pruning to prevent a long term build up of things just because you&#8217;ve always done them.</p>



<p>A note on the ii community app deletion:  As a general rule I don&#8217;t have social media profiles as they take up too much time generally in mindless scrolling.  I did find that community quite useful to improve some of my <a href="/thoughts-on/money/">financial strategies</a> but I was spending a lot of time reading and posting on there.  Since deleting the profile, I have found that I&#8217;m keeping on top of my personal admin related to volunteering activities, so that has been a net benefit too.</p>



<p>Another update worth mentioning:  In <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/winter-solstice-2024-volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/" data-type="post" data-id="1907">my review last winter</a>, I made a big change by stepping back from organising the <a href="https://festival.dursleywelcomeswalkers.org.uk/">Dursley Walking Festival</a>.  This did bring the expected benefits over the summer &#8211; I was able to focus better on other projects as well as dealing with a family matter.  I still helped out by hosting the <a href="https://discoverdursley.org.uk/2025-dursley-walking-festival/">programme on Discover Dursley</a>, but that was not really a great deal of work.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also been able to get stuck into some <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/content-consolidation/" data-type="post" data-id="2596">personal computer projects</a> over the last few months &#8211; something I wanted to do for ages but couldn&#8217;t find the head space before. Another positive outcome from tilting the balance in my life between volunteering and other activities.</p>



<p>So, here is my current list of volunteering activities that reflect the above and other changes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Volunteer organising</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dursley Code Club</li>



<li>Dursley Green Drinks/Hub</li>



<li>Riverfly Monitoring at three sites</li>



<li>Stroud Wildlife Survey Group</li>



<li>Glorious Grasslands survey data</li>



<li>The Artocalypse</li>



<li>Discover Dursley Website</li>



<li>Uley Trees and Meadows</li>



<li>Community Code project with Rednock and The Engine</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Volunteer participation</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Glorious Grasslands Habitat management/Seed Harvesting</li>



<li>GWT Canal group</li>



<li>Pockett&#8217;s Orchard work party</li>



<li>SVP Canal group</li>



<li>Discover Dursley</li>



<li>SVP Tree group</li>



<li>Offbeat Dursley</li>
</ul>



<p>This list, while quite long, is way more manageable than when I <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/volunteer-responsibility-amnesty-day/" data-type="post" data-id="797">first did this exercise</a>. Having this amnesty day in the calendar has really helped me keep control and perspective on my volunteering activities.</p>
