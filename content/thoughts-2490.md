<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-fe9cc265 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Each week, I interview someone about their financial journey and their approach to money. By reading experiences shared by others, I hope you will be inspired to improve your own financial outcomes a little.</p>



<p>Today is the turn of <a href="https://rosipov.com/blog/about/">Ruslan Osipov</a> who settled in the US in early adulthood and is building a robust strategy for early retirement. Ruslan also has <a href="https://rosipov.com/">an excellent blog</a> where he also writes about his approach to money.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tell us a little bit about you … </h3>



<p>My name is Ruslan. I’m in my mid-thirties, I live in San Diego, California with my wife and daughter &#8211; and I currently work at Google as an engineering manager focused on improving company-wide engineering productivity.</p>



<p>I grew up outside of the United States &#8211; in a small rural town in Russia. I grew up with my mom &#8211; we weren’t particularly well off nor did we want for anything &#8211; and my mom’s approach to finance influenced my views. My mom was (she’s well, but retired) an accountant who survived the USSR breakup, numerous currency changes, multiple recessions and currency inflation &#8211; the financial landscape was marred by instability. Probably because of that, my mom is very frugal and deliberate with money.</p>



<p>Money was (and still is) always kept on the top of the fridge, with currency reserves safely tucked under a mattress. As a kid, I could always take the money for picking up groceries or bus fare to school, but I needed to ask my mom for frivolous spending &#8211; be it toys or sweets. And turns out I didn’t ask that frequently: my mom went to great length explaining why certain purchases were and weren’t made, what the opportunity cost of the purchase is, or if something could be an impulse buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When and how did you start investing?</h3>



<p>This attitude served me well when I moved to the US at the ripe age of 18 or 19. I worked multiple jobs, ate ramen, rented a small room, and saved aggressively &#8211; I didn’t keep diligent accounting, but I wouldn’t be surprised if my savings rate was anywhere between 60% to 80% (considering multiple minimum income jobs &#8211; I was young and did work over 80 hours a week).</p>



<p>Within a year in the US I found my way into a paid software development internship, which paved the way for a lucrative software engineering career. My partner at the time was less thrifty than me &#8211; the spending crept up, and we quickly burned through the cash cushion I’ve accumulated.</p>



<p>Eventually my then-partner and I parted ways. I resumed accumulation, and even <a href="https://rosipov.com/blog/prius-adventures-a-year-later/">moved into my Toyota Prius for a year</a> &#8211; to see the United States mostly, but the savings were a nice benefit.</p>



<p>Before this point I didn’t really know about investing, and while holding a software development job I started to invest in my 401k &#8211; I definitely didn’t max it out, and I wouldn’t say I understood what I was doing.</p>



<p>Then I met a woman who’s now a mother of my kiddo. We were quickly becoming good friends, and she introduced me to MrMoneyMustache and the fantastical world of FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early &#8211; it’s a dumb acronym) and investing. No longer did I stash away money in my checking account, I now obsessively started looking for ways to identify tax-advantaged vessels, understanding how investing works, how to model withdrawal rates, and so on.</p>



<p>It became a fun thing to discover and obsess over for both my then-friend-now-wife and I.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are your goals for money?</h3>



<p>Independence.</p>



<p>A feeling of freedom is something I value deep inside &#8211; it’s why I initially moved to the United States, it’s why I run my own cloud services, it’s why I work hard, and it’s why I invest and have a cash cushion.</p>



<p>I still nurture a dream of early retirement &#8211; but it’s a hard plug to pull &#8211; between the financial stability the job provides, the nightmare that is the private American healthcare market, and the neverending feeling that I need, maybe, 20% more assets to feel set for the future.</p>



<p>Money is a tool for living a good life &#8211; one of many, and I’m still trying to understand what discretionary spend and luxuries bring us joy, and which ones are complete fluff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you aiming for full retirement significantly below the age of 50?</h3>



<p>Definitely yes. Hard maybe? For sure probably.</p>



<p>Being in my mid-thirties and having the ability to retire early within my grasp feels exhilarating, but also scary. I spent the past decade and a half getting a lot of my self-worth and satisfaction out of my career, and stepping away from the corporate world fills me with anxiety. There’s always this next corporate milestone, the next project, the next crowning achievement after which I’d feel like it’d be a good time to retire.</p>



<p>I had a recent family addition, and that’s informing my desire to be more present in my kid’s life. Wanting to spend time with my kiddo might end up tilting the balance further towards early retirement.</p>



<p>Either way, I definitely want to be able to retire early &#8211; regardless of actually following through. Freedom’s important to me.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Which aspects of the FIRE philosophy do you follow, and which do you ignore?</h3>



<p>I think I generally follow the two core tenets I could think of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Save aggressively</strong>: This changes year-to-year, and a cushy corporate job helps with flexibility. Throughout the accumulation phase, our savings rate moves between 50% and 80% &#8211; depending on what’s going on with our life.</li>



<li><strong>Invest passively</strong>: We prioritize index funds investments, and our strategy has been “set it and forget it”. This really helps, because life has a tendency to get in the way, and there are stretches of multiple years where financial goals aren’t a priority. I’m really thankful for the simple strategies when that happens.</li>
</ul>



<p>What I really enjoyed about FIRE is a slightly more concrete set of goals and specifically investment principles I could follow. I’ve always been thrifty, but there wasn’t much of a philosophy or a coherent financial strategy behind it.</p>



<p>Many financial influencers have put different spins on the concept &#8211; it’s like the trendy workout and dieting regimens with fancy names. You’re still eating your vegetables and working out, but it’s exciting to have it be “a thing”.</p>



<p>Some rhetoric is a little more extreme when it comes to savings, and we’ve been trying to find a balance of enjoying our life today (through paid experiences and, yes, occasional lattes at a coffee shop) and saving for the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you in the accumulation pre-retirement phase or drawdown?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I’m firmly in the accumulation phase. It’s unclear how long it’ll be until the desired retirement date.</p>



<p>We’re fortunate enough to both work in well paid corporate jobs, so we can probably afford to retire now-ish if we were to make some adjustments &#8211; we live in San Diego &#8211; a high cost of living area &#8211; where a pint of beer will run you a little under $10 and a small urban home price is climbing ever close to a million. But this also comes with a uniquely pleasant all-year-round mild weather &#8211; it’s rarely too hot or too cold here &#8211; the temperature has the tendency to feel “just right” majority of the time, and we do enjoy the food scene and the community. We’d be especially secure if we leverage geographic arbitrage &#8211; something we’ve been openly discussing.</p>



<p>There’s also the work in the big tech companies: these pay better than the rest of the industry, but are hard to get into (especially after taking a long break). The work can be fun and engaging, but “golden handcuffs” is a common phrase my colleagues and I throw around the office.</p>



<p>We’ll probably need another couple of years of stable market conditions and our dual corporate income if we were to keep up the lifestyle in retirement &#8211; we’re relatively frugal, but when a meal at a restaurant with a round of drinks and a dessert crossed a $100 mark &#8211; there’s a need for a larger nest egg.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do you plan day-to-day spend to support your lifestyle?</h3>



<p>My wife and I have a different approach to personal finance &#8211; she likes to bucket expenses, budget, and squirrel away money in various accounts. I just follow the spirits of my ancestors to guide my spending and move what’s left into savings.</p>



<p>This surprisingly doesn’t cause tension because:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>We have the same goals &#8211; and we’re both quite frugal.</li>



<li>We communicate proactively and often (I talk about that in detail <a href="https://rosipov.com/blog/our-monthly-family-finance-huddle/">here</a>).</li>
</ol>



<p>We’re frugal for our income bracket, but we do indulge in our share of luxuries &#8211; travel and restaurants being the bigger expenses. This places us at anywhere between 50% and 70% when it comes to annual savings rate. We’re trying to find a balance between saving for the future and enjoying our life today. Mr Money Mustache would jump out with a pitchfork here and say you don’t need money to enjoy your life, but we do enjoy our discretionary spending.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How would you describe your investing style?</h3>



<p>Set it and forget it.</p>



<p>I’m definitely not an active investor. In fact, I’ve tried setting up a tiny active investing fund 5 years ago (what my wife and I collectively refer to as “the gambling fund”), and I’m firmly in the red, nearly 50% down last time I checked.</p>



<p>We invest in index funds &#8211; with a fairly aggressive 90/10 stock/bond split, and a 60/40 US/international split within. It’s all standard Vanguard Admiral funds here. Our personal investor policy statement outlines our goals, how we invest, and rationale behind our decision making. I <a href="https://bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement">highly recommend putting one together</a> if you haven’t yet. I haven’t posted ours publicly, but if I do &#8211; I’ll reach out to Chris to include it here.</p>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">I’m assuming you have a spreadsheet &#8230; what are your key assumptions?</h3>



<p>Of course I have a spreadsheet! How did you know? I guess I must give off that big-spreadsheet-energy.</p>



<p>We make the following assumptions when modeling our retirement income and spending:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>4% withdrawal rate informed by the Trinity study. Many FI folks lower this percentage, but we’re young, flexible, and have an aggressive portfolio. We typically run our projections with either a variable return rate, or by modeling income and expenses &#8211; but that’s just not as snappy as saying “4%”.</li>



<li>3% inflation seems reasonable for the US-heavy (60/40) portfolio, but the time will tell.</li>



<li>6% inflation adjusted expected return seemed like a reasonable conservative default</li>



<li>2.5% inflation adjusted expected dividend yield is what I’ve seen used as simplified modeling for bonds</li>
</ul>



<p>In terms of expenses, the biggest unknown here is healthcare &#8211; not something your UK readers will empathise with. There are subsidies depending on your level of income, and your postal code can significantly impact medical insurance prices &#8211; one can expect to pay anywhere from $400 to $2,000 a month for medical coverage and it’s a nightmare to model. Freedom extends to freedom to die if you can’t afford healthcare I guess.</p>



<p>Oh and by the way, I’ve been really enjoying <a href="https://projectionlab.com/">ProjectionLab</a> &#8211; it’s a powerful but also user friendly tool that helps with modeling many different scenarios. I’ve used it to explore scenarios too cumbersome to build out in a spreadsheet. Lots of what-if scenarios.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What advice would you have for young people thinking of emigrating to the US?</h3>



<p>A lot of stars aligned for me the right way &#8211; I happened to have a cousin in the US who was able to help me get my bearings, an old pen pal of mine helped me a great deal, and I got lucky with a choice of career &#8211; I joined tech during a hiring boom, I had a decade long but relatively painless path to citizenship.</p>



<p>Unlike my small hometown in Russia, the US truly felt like the land of opportunity &#8211; I could achieve things as long as I was willing to work for them &#8211; and I didn’t need to be related to someone with a good career to get into said career. I don’t know how much of this was due to me leaving home and going somewhere new, but there was, and still is, a great deal of fairness and equality in comparison with more emerging economies.</p>



<p>The current political climate in the United States has been changing (shocker, I know). As someone who was a frequent visitor to the same United States Customs and Immigration office for nearly a decade, I can see that the vibe has changed. Where I felt welcomed by immigration officials with open arms there are now pictures of Latin American immigrants in handcuffs. Where the employees used to welcome me with a smile, there’s now a charged, adversarial atmosphere. But as they say here, your mileage may vary.</p>



<p>I don’t really want to discourage anyone, but I think this is an important bit of context. With that, and the preamble that I came to the United States 15 years ago, here’s the advice that worked for me. I think this is a generic advice that could work for immigrating anywhere as a young, passionate, and energetic person:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be prepared for the initial grind</strong>: It took me some time to get a foothold &#8211; everything is different &#8211; social norms, how you get groceries, how you get paid. These things take time, and working extra hard in the beginning pays off (to learn the culture, get a foothold work-wise or educate yourself on a chosen career path).</li>



<li><strong>Persistence pays off</strong>: There’s a great deal of luck involved in success (in fact, you should be wary of people who only attribute their successes to their own prowess). But success is only possible if you’re there to capitalize on these opportunities as they present themselves. It took me three attempts to be accepted at Google, with multi-year cooldown periods and lots of preparation in between.</li>



<li><strong>Build a support network</strong>: I had a cousin in the US, but even with that it took me a very long time to build a support network. I didn’t want to only socialize with fellow immigrants (I’m a huge believer in engaging with the culture if you choose to move to a place) &#8211; and assimilating into the culture enough to have shared context for friend-making took time and effort.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Research your career path</strong>: I lucked out into a software engineering career &#8211; it’s something I always wanted to do, and it happened to be in demand at the time. You should do your research and identify which careers are on the rise and in demand.</li>



<li><strong>Understand your “why”:</strong> For me moving to the United States was all about freedom. While there are many countries that can provide that, the unique American freedom flavor always spoke to me. Keeping your “why” in mind can help when things get tough.</li>



<li><strong>Financial education is key</strong>: If you’re reading Chris’s blog, I imagine you already know the fundamentals &#8211; savings is good, tax-advantaged accounts are good, investing is good. Start learning about the country’s financial system, quickly &#8211; sound financial decisions compound over time.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What sources do you use to educate and inform yourself about money?&nbsp; </h3>



<p>I’m trying to build up a personal feed of fellow independent bloggers (like Chris) I can learn from, but so far I’ve been mostly following the big names:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr Money Mustache</a> (classic)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.millennial-revolution.com/">Millennial Revolution</a> (Canadian always-traveling couple)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.madfientist.com/">Mad Fientist</a> (he hasn’t been active lately)</li>
</ul>



<p>I also enjoy reading the <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/">Bogleheads forums</a>, these are a trove of information. You can find many anonymous case studies there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are some areas that you’d like to hear about from other people’s financial journeys?</h3>



<p>The other day I stumbled upon an article by someone who retired early years ago, but ran into issues and had to get back to work. I can’t find it anymore, but I think it provided much needed perspective in a world full of influencers whose job depends on their appearance of financial competence. I’d love to learn from people’s failures too, as long as they don’t mind sharing. I think that can sometimes be a lot more valuable than “look how well I’ve planned”.</p>
