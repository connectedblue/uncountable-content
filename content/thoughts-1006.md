<p>I can now post quick thoughts to the <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/">Quick Thoughts</a> section of my blog and they won&#8217;t appear on the front page or the main RSS feed.  </p>



<p>So no-one alse is disturbed by these random things.  </p>



<p>But if you do happen to want to see them, you can visit <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts">the page</a> or subscribe to them via RSS using the url <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/feed">https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/feed</a></p>
