<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Got the 9.30am train down to Wellington.  Much easier than driving.  Got to Wellington and it was cold and quite windy but the weather cleared up later.</p>
<p>Walked around the harbourside to the Te Papa museum.  It&#8217;s a huge place and very modern  (about 10 years old).  It&#8217;s on lots of floors and is all about different aspects of New Zealand life.  We saw the history floor which was full of really good exhibits.  Free to enter as well.</p>
<p>Had to go across to the library afterwards to print out the passes for Kaptiti Island and also the flights back from Christchurch later this month.</p>
<p>After some lunch by the waterside, we took the cable car up to the Botanic Gardens which have a great view over the city.  Walked back down to the railway station to get the train back</div>
