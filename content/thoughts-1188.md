<p>I left the town I grew up in after school in 1987. I still return regularly return because the parental home is there, but it&#8217;s on the outskirts so I&#8217;m generally in and out without paying too much attention.</p>



<p>Today I had an hour free after getting some groceries, so I took the opportunity to walk around and see what had changed.  I walked slowly to try and remember what was in each part during the 80&#8217;s when that was the place I knew best.</p>



<p>The basic layout and buildings haven&#8217;t really changed, but plenty of details have.  The old library is now a wellness centre, but stands out in it&#8217;s historic plot surrounded by modern buildings.  The old car park behind Boots is now a paved square with a whole host of new facilities.</p>



<p>The indoor market, which also had an outdoor component is now impossible to locate.  As is King&#8217;s shade walk which was a tiny closed off square of shops accessible through an alleyway.</p>



<p>I briefly scanned the faces to see if by chance I might bump into someone I know.  But even if I did pass someone, time will have painted over signs of recognition.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t feel a strong affinity or attachment to the town.  It&#8217;s one of several hundred identikit places that circle London.  I&#8217;m glad I live where I do now.</p>



<p>I am in a WhatsApp group with school friends though, which is my link to the past.  Having shared experiences and memories is a much more powerful draw than a bunch of buildings that morph over time.</p>



<p>The WhatsApp chat is pretty much like it would be in the Barley Mow except we are spread all over the world.  I think we all prefer it that way.</p>
