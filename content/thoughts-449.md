<p>Bit of a river themed week.  Regular raft monitoring last Sunday, natural flood management with FWAG on Monday and water vole displacement on Wednesday.  </p>



<p>Also did the regular Wild Acres day on Tuesday and the monthly Orchard party on Saturday.  Popped into the council offices one evening for a committee meeting on the environmental land management plans for the town.</p>



<p>Spun up a new instance of FreshRSS to begin customising a new artocalypse service.  Early days, but this is turning into an exciting IndieWeb project</p>
