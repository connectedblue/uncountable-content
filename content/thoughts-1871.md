<p>The upcoming UK budget on 30 October is one of the most eagerly anticipated for quite a few years.  So, I thought it would be a good idea to make some predictions which I can review afterwards to see how many came to pass.</p>



<p>For the record, it&#8217;s October 18 when I write this, about a week and a half before the budget itself.  In no particular order, here is what I think we&#8217;ll see:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Include pension pots as part of your estate and remove the tax-free benefits for heirs if you die before age 75.</li>



<li>Remove the &#8220;rollover allowance&#8221; for when the first person in a couple dies and leaves their entire estate to their spouse. In other words, on the death of the second spouse, only one lot of tax free band applies for inheritance tax purposes.</li>



<li>Reduce maximum annual contributions from £60,000 to £40,000.</li>



<li>Reduce maximum tax free cash to £250,000, but retain the rate at 25%.</li>



<li>Remove the tax free transfer of ISA on death of a spouse (currently the surviving spouse has their £20,000 annual ISA limit increased temporarily by the amount of their partner&#8217;s ISA on death.  This allows it to be transferred intact to the survivor&#8217;s ISA account).</li>



<li>Increase capital gains tax to income tax bands of 20% and 40%, including investment property.</li>



<li>Increase Employer national insurance.</li>
</ul>



<p>And for completeness, here&#8217;s a list of things that are speculation but I don&#8217;t think will be touched:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Overall cap on ISA portfolio</li>



<li>No RPI indexation on capital gains before taxable amount is calculated.</li>



<li>No wealth tax on super rich.</li>
</ul>



<p>That&#8217;s my predictions locked in now &#8230; I&#8217;ll write a review post after the budget to see how much I got right and wrong.</p>
