<p>Dave urged us to write a post today about why we support <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the Writer&#8217;s Web</a> .  This means adhering to the essence of the original web design, but practised with modern tools:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow is-style-plain--5">
<p>The web was initially <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">designed</a> for writers. Styling, links, paragraphs, titles (at all levels). The ability to edit. No character limits. That&#8217;s what we had to work with when we started blogging in the mid-late 90s. </p>



<p>Then there was a big <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/22/tenYearsUsingTwitter.html">corner-turn</a> in 2006. In an instant the web shrunk to almost nothing. No titles, no style, no links, 140 chars max. Enough to say &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting in line at the bank.&#8221; Nothing wrong with that, but it isn&#8217;t what I think of as writing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m new to writing on the web, having started <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/">my diary</a> in 2023 and this blog in 2024.  At the time of writing (March 2025) I have published around 700 posts across both.  The diary is self explanatory &#8211; it&#8217;s simply a record of my life, projects and passions.   Having one web page per day allows the freedom to be as brief or expansive as I choose.</p>



<p>About a year into writing the diary, I had the urge to write about a much wider range of topics.  It would have spoilt the vibe of the diary to throw in a random post about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/everything-is-less-than-0-12/">why everything is less than  0.12</a>, so I created this space to be as neutral a place as possible and have no limits on what I can write about.</p>



<p>I now think of this blog as my own magazine, and RSS as my paper boy.  There are large sections on <a href="/thoughts-on/money/">money</a> and <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/thoughts-on/digital-life/">digital living</a>, a curated <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/wildlife-articles/" data-type="post" data-id="146">wildlife news feed</a> and a series of interviews about <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/people-and-money-new-series/" data-type="post" data-id="1974">People &amp; Money</a>.</p>



<p>The blogs exist only for my entertainment, but along the way I started to notice other people were subscribing by RSS.  So, I put a lot more thought into what <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/what-to-show-you-next/" data-type="post" data-id="1462">my website&#8217;s RSS experience</a> should look like.  This led me to two distinct modes of preparing content:  Writing and Editing.</p>



<p>Writing is the main thing.  It&#8217;s as frequent or infrequent as I choose, on whatever pops into my head.  But I don&#8217;t want to unnecessarily burden RSS subscribers with everything I write (the default behaviour of wordpress).  So some things get excluded from the main feed, such as <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/topic/quick-thoughts/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="10">Quick thoughts</a>.</p>



<p>I also want to re-surface previous content from time to time.  I do this by simply changing the publish date of the article so it appears at the top of the feed again.  Again, this is me as an editor, so my feed is &#8220;here&#8217;s what I want to show you next&#8221; rather than &#8220;here&#8217;s what I wrote today&#8221;.</p>



<p>Writing, publishing, editing are all essential pillars of my digital creation.  Using my own platform allows me to do it how I want.  But being part of the Writer&#8217;s Web allows me to share, learn and interact with other writers out there.</p>
