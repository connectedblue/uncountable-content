<p>Still no heating or hot water due to the boiler not working after getting back from holiday.  But the heating engineer is coming this morning to hopefully get everything back on track.</p>



<p>So I went out very early, at first light, for the regular raft check so I&#8217;d be back home in time to wait for the engineer. The first raft I visited had overturned and the cartridge lost. The river was also too deep and too fast flowing to risk going in, so it&#8217;ll have to stay like that until levels drop.</p>



<p>The second raft had a magnificent pair of otter footprints on the cartridge.  I can&#8217;t recall seeing prints on this one before, although there is often speint.  The third raft had no signs of anything at all.</p>



<p>Paul arrived around 11am to work on the boiler.  After checking various things for 15 minutes, he concluded that there&#8217;s no gas coming in from the meter, so he went to check the supply point and confirmed this was the case.  This meant a call to Octopus who are the meter asset owner to get them to replace it.  </p>



<p>Despite promising a four hour call out, they just sent lots of aimless emails and by the time 7.30pm arrived, still no engineer.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I headed over to the library for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a>.  All eight places taken today so I was dashing around all of them &#8211; having to context switch between python, scratch, HTML and Javascript.  They are all regulars deep into their own projects, so it get&#8217;s tricky to remember where each is up to.</p>
