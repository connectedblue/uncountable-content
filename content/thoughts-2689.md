<p>At the time of writing (October 2025) stock markets are at all-time highs and plenty of people, myself included, are wondering whether this is the peak before a multi year period of steep decline.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/tough-at-the-top/" data-type="post" data-id="2663">tough at the top</a>.</p>



<p>In all honesty, I have literally no idea. I&#8217;m pretty certain in 15 years time, markets will be higher than today, but no clue where they&#8217;ll be at the end of this year or next. </p>



<p>So I&#8217;m just staying invested and living off my <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/holding-cash-in-drawdown/" data-type="post" data-id="1798">four year cash buffer</a>. However, I did make a move this week that protects my cash flows over the next six months. </p>



<p>At the start of each new tax year in April, I take an <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/draining-and-recycling-the-sipp/" data-type="post" data-id="2217">annual withdrawal from my SIPP</a>  to top up the cash bucket.  I saw the current market highs as being a good opportunity to prepare for that now.</p>



<p>I do know today how much the withdrawal will be, so I sold that amount of equity and put the proceeds into Money Market Funds (MMF) &#8211; currently yielding 4.65%pa. These still reside under the tax free SIPP wrapper &#8211; they haven&#8217;t been withdrawn yet.</p>



<p>This gives me peace of mind.  If the market is lower is six months time, then I won&#8217;t be concerned.  If the market happens to be higher, then my theoretical loss is relatively small in the grand scheme of things.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s an additional benefit too &#8211; by carving out the cash now, all I have to do next April is the admin of completing the withdrawal and reclaiming the tax overpayment via P55.  It means I won&#8217;t be caught up in whatever emotions are swirling around the market next year (or potentially get influenced to delay the withdrawal).</p>



<p>As ever, no-one knows what the future holds for the markets.  But being intentional helps remove some of the emotions uncertainty brings.</p>
