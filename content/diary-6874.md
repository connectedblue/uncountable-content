<p>Another session of habitat restoration on the Sports field this morning following the <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/12/new-trees-for-the-playing-field/" data-type="post" data-id="6770">tree planting last month</a>.  There were five of us, and after a quick inspection of the trees, we focused on the wildflower strip in the far southern corner.</p>



<p>It was very pleasing to see that the mower had been in and cut the whole strip.  There isn&#8217;t a grass collecting attachment though, so the clippings still need to be raked off to encourage the wild flowers.  But this made the work a whole lot easier</p>



<p>The main challenge on this site is removing the arisings, so we had a tarpaulin we could use to drag them over to the file on the far corner behind a shed.</p>



<p>We then were able to sow some brush harvested see I had obtained from <a href="https://www.cotswolds-nl.org.uk/looking-after/our-grasslands-projects/glorious-cotswolds-grasslands/">Glorious Grasslands</a>.  We had enough to cover around 500 square meters so that will make a nice seedbank to spread across the rest of the margin over the coming years.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I held another session of the Lego Robot Challenge after school club at Rednock School.  There is a session in front of judges on 27 February, and this seemed to focus their minds.  Good progress made on two of the challenges today and everyone was engaged on the tasks.</p>
