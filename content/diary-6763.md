<p>It was the first <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/series/uley-trees-and-meadows/" data-type="post_tag" data-id="29">Uley Trees &amp; Meadows</a> winter work party this season, and the forecast wasn&#8217;t good.  I was leading the Uley Common task, and three hardy souls joined me to make a start.</p>



<p>We achieved an awful lot last year and the common is in a good state now to have incremental management.  The task today was to cut and rake the grass at the southern end and remove overhanging branches from the woodland edge.</p>



<p>We have a new brush cutter for the project, so David started on that while everyone else tackled the branches.  The dead material was used to block a temporary path created in the southern boundary, which had opened up after we <a href="https://diary.uncountable.uk/2025/02/ash-removal-on-the-common/" data-type="post" data-id="4279">removed the ash</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>Around one hour in, the heavens opened and didn&#8217;t really stop.  I took over the brush cutting and we managed to get a good portion of the southern end cut, with the arisings removed.  This is vital to remove nutrient from the grassland and enable the smaller wildflowers to thrive among the dominant grasses.</p>



<p>We packed up around midday and, soaking wet, made our way back.  I was glad we got the session complete, and we can move to other projects over the rest of the winter season.</p>



<p>In the afternoon, I went down to <a href="https://rednockschool.org.uk/">Rednock School</a> for the last lego robot club of the term.  They have been working on various different aspects of the challenge over the last few weeks, and I wanted to focus today on bringing everything together to complete the first mission.</p>



<p>Only four students turned up today, but it was good to have a focused group.  I was super impressed with how they worked together and built the various parts and code to navigate the obstacle.  By the end of the session, they had pretty much achieved it, and we&#8217;ll be in a good position to get cracking with the rest next term.</p>
