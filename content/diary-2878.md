<p>This morning was a face to face meeting of the Visit Dursley group in the town council offices.  We meet once a quarter over zoom and discuss how best to encourage more visitors to the town.  But sometimes it&#8217;s just better to be face to face, so we met in the historic Jacob&#8217;s House in Dursley (location of the town council offices).</p>



<p>There were five of us, and we reviewed the new town centre maps, discussed the e-bike scheme and worked out a way to connect the town centre with the art trail at the back of the woods.</p>



<p>A new piece of woodland has just been purchased, so it gives more options to make clearer pathways for visitors so they don&#8217;t get lost.  We can put in some more roundels and posts, and produce some dedicated leaflets.  </p>



<p>In the afternoon I held the regular python <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dursleycodeclub">Dursley Code Club</a> in the library.  We had all eight PCs in use again, and everyone made strides in their ongoing projects.  Not really any new children these days &#8211; the sessions are all booked out by regulars.</p>
