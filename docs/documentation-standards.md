# Documentation Standards

Guidelines for creating and maintaining comprehensive documentation for the WordPress Content Service.

## Documentation Philosophy

All documentation must be:

- **Comprehensive**: Cover all features, APIs, and usage scenarios
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update as the system evolves
- **Accessible**: Clear language and logical organization
- **Current**: Always reflect the actual state of the system
- **Practical**: Include working examples and real-world usage

## Documentation Architecture

### File Organization

Documentation follows a structured organization pattern:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Main documentation index
├── development-standards.md     # Development principles and workflow
├── version-control.md          # Branching and change management
├── testing.md                  # Testing standards and practices
├── documentation-standards.md   # This file - documentation guidelines
├── testable-architecture.md    # Architectural principles
├── architecture.md             # System architecture overview
├── api-reference.md            # Service APIs and interfaces
├── configuration.md            # Environment and site configuration
├── deployment.md               # Deployment and CI/CD
├── troubleshooting.md          # Common issues and solutions
└── changelog.md                # Version history and changes
```

### Documentation Types

#### Standards Documentation
Core principles and guidelines that govern development:
- Development standards and workflow
- Version control and change management
- Testing standards and practices
- Documentation standards (this document)
- Testable architecture requirements

#### Technical Documentation
System-specific documentation for implementation:
- Architecture overview and design decisions
- API reference with examples
- Configuration and environment setup
- Deployment processes and procedures

#### User Documentation
Guidance for using the WordPress Content Service:
- Installation and setup instructions
- CLI command reference and examples
- Configuration guide for WordPress sites
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Content Standards

### Document Structure

Each documentation file must follow this structure:

```markdown
# Document Title

Brief overview of what this document covers and its purpose.

## Section Headings

Use H2 (##) for main sections within the document.

### Subsections

Use H3 (###) for subsections when needed.

#### Detailed Points

Use H4 (####) for specific implementation details.

## Code Examples

Include working code examples for all concepts.

## Related Documentation

Link to related documents and resources.
```

### Writing Style Guidelines

#### Clarity and Conciseness
- **Use clear, direct language** without unnecessary jargon
- **Write for developers** with appropriate technical detail
- **Include context** for all examples and concepts
- **Explain the "why"** not just the "how"

#### Consistency
- **Use consistent terminology** throughout all documentation
- **Follow standard formatting** for code, commands, and examples
- **Maintain consistent structure** across similar document types
- **Use the same voice and tone** across all documentation

### Code Documentation Standards

#### Inline Code Documentation

All functions and services must include comprehensive JSDoc comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Fetches posts from a WordPress site with pagination support
 * 
 * @param siteConfig - Configuration for the WordPress site
 * @param sinceDate - Optional date to fetch posts since (for incremental sync)
 * @returns Promise resolving to array of WordPress posts
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const posts = await fetchPosts(siteConfig, new Date('2025-07-01'));
 * console.log(`Fetched ${posts.length} posts`);
 * ```
 * 
 * @throws {ApiError} When WordPress API returns error response
 * @throws {NetworkError} When network request fails
 */
export async function fetchPosts(
  siteConfig: SiteConfig, 
  sinceDate?: Date
): Promise<WordPressPost[]> {
  // Implementation here
}
```

#### API Documentation

All service APIs must be documented with:

- **Purpose and overview** of the service
- **Method signatures** with complete type information
- **Parameter descriptions** including optional parameters
- **Return value descriptions** with example structures
- **Error conditions** and exception handling
- **Usage examples** showing real-world implementation

### Example Documentation

#### Service Documentation Template

```markdown
# Service Name

Brief description of what this service does and its role in the system.

## Overview

Detailed explanation of the service's purpose and how it fits into the overall architecture.

## API Reference

### Method Name

Description of what this method does.

**Parameters:**
- `param1` (Type): Description of parameter
- `param2` (Type, optional): Description of optional parameter

**Returns:**
- `ReturnType`: Description of return value

**Example:**
```typescript
const result = await service.methodName(param1, param2);
```

**Throws:**
- `ErrorType`: Description of when this error occurs

## Configuration

Description of any configuration requirements.

## Related Services

Links to related services and their documentation.
```

## Documentation Maintenance

### Update Requirements

Documentation must be updated whenever:

- **New features are added** - Document all new functionality
- **APIs change** - Update interface documentation immediately
- **Configuration changes** - Update setup and configuration docs
- **Dependencies change** - Update installation instructions
- **Bug fixes affect behavior** - Update relevant examples

### Review Process

All documentation changes must:

1. **Be reviewed** as part of the code review process
2. **Include examples** that have been tested and verified
3. **Link to related documentation** that may be affected
4. **Update the changelog** if user-facing behavior changes

### Quality Assurance

#### Documentation Validation
- **Check all links** work and point to correct resources
- **Verify all examples** actually work as documented
- **Ensure code samples** use current API signatures
- **Validate formatting** renders correctly in markdown

#### Consistency Checks
- **Terminology usage** is consistent across all docs
- **Code style** matches project standards
- **Structure and formatting** follows established patterns
- **Cross-references** are accurate and helpful

## Tools and Automation

### Documentation Build Process

While this project doesn't include a documentation site build process, documentation should be written with future automation in mind:

- **Use standard markdown** that renders well in GitHub and other viewers
- **Include proper frontmatter** if documentation site is added later
- **Structure content** for automated navigation generation
- **Use consistent formatting** that works with documentation generators

### Link Validation

Regular validation of internal and external links:

- **Internal links** to other documentation files
- **External links** to WordPress documentation, npm packages, etc.
- **Code links** to specific files and line numbers
- **API references** to external documentation

## Documentation as Code

### Version Control Integration

Documentation is treated as code:

- **All changes tracked** in version control
- **Documentation updates** included in feature branches
- **Peer review required** for all documentation changes
- **Documentation tests** validate examples and links

### Automated Checks

Future automation should include:

- **Link checking** to ensure all references work
- **Example validation** to ensure code samples are current
- **Style checking** for consistent formatting and terminology
- **Coverage analysis** to ensure all features are documented

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Documentation

#### Structure Information Logically
- **Start with overview** and purpose
- **Progress from general to specific** concepts
- **Include practical examples** early and often
- **End with troubleshooting** and related resources

#### Make It Scannable
- **Use descriptive headings** that clearly indicate content
- **Include table of contents** for longer documents
- **Use bullet points and lists** for easy scanning
- **Highlight important information** with appropriate formatting

#### Include Complete Examples
- **Show realistic usage** not just API signatures
- **Include expected output** where relevant
- **Provide context** for when to use different approaches
- **Cover error scenarios** and how to handle them

### Maintaining Documentation Quality

#### Regular Reviews
- **Schedule periodic reviews** of all documentation
- **Update examples** to use current best practices
- **Remove outdated information** that no longer applies
- **Add missing documentation** identified during development

#### User Feedback Integration
- **Monitor common questions** that indicate documentation gaps
- **Update based on user experience** and actual usage patterns
- **Add troubleshooting sections** for frequently encountered issues
- **Include more examples** for commonly misunderstood concepts
