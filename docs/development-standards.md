# Development Standards

Comprehensive development standards and guidelines for the WordPress Content Service to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across the codebase.

## Overview

The development standards are organized into key areas that ensure code quality and maintainability:

### Core Development Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic extracted from CLI commands into testable services
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each function exists in exactly one place to avoid duplication
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All services, utilities, and APIs are thoroughly documented
- **Consistent Standards**: All code follows established patterns and conventions

### Service-Oriented Architecture
- **WordPress API Service**: Handles all WordPress REST API interactions
- **Content Writer Service**: Manages markdown file generation and frontmatter
- **CLI Commands**: Thin wrappers that orchestrate services
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized site and environment configuration

## Development Workflow

1. **Design**: Plan features with testable architecture in mind
2. **Branch**: Create feature branch with appropriate naming convention
3. **Implementation**: Follow the service-oriented architecture patterns
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for all services and utilities
5. **Documentation**: Document all new features and API changes
6. **Version Update**: **MANDATORY** - Update version in package.json and changelog
7. **Review**: Ensure all standards are met before deployment
8. **Merge**: Merge to main only after version update and approval

## Code Organization Standards

### Service Layer Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/           # Configuration management
â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # Core business logic services
â”œâ”€â”€ cli/             # Command-line interface implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ utils/           # Shared utility functions
```

### Service Design Patterns
- **Services contain business logic** and are fully testable
- **CLI commands are thin wrappers** that call service methods
- **All services export clear interfaces** with TypeScript types
- **Error handling is consistent** across all services

### Testing Requirements
- **All services must have comprehensive test coverage**
- **CLI commands should have integration tests**
- **Mock external dependencies** (WordPress APIs) in tests
- **Use consistent test data fixtures** across the test suite

## Version Control Requirements

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: All feature branches MUST update the application version before merging to main.**

- Update `package.json` version following semantic versioning
- Add changelog entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
- Ensure version bump reflects the scope of changes (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- See [Version Control Guidelines](./version-control.md) for detailed process

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled for type safety
- **ESLint configuration** for code consistency
- **Clear function and variable naming** that describes purpose
- **Comprehensive error handling** with meaningful error messages

### Documentation Quality
- **JSDoc comments** for all public functions and services
- **README files** for each major component
- **API documentation** for all service interfaces
- **Usage examples** for CLI commands and services

### Performance Standards
- **Efficient API usage** with proper rate limiting
- **Minimal memory footprint** for large content processing
- **Concurrent processing** where appropriate
- **Graceful error handling** that doesn't break the entire sync

## Security Considerations

- **Input validation** for all external data (WordPress APIs)
- **Safe file operations** with proper path validation
- **Environment variable management** for sensitive configuration
- **Rate limiting** to respect WordPress API limits
